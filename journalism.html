						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>Blog<br/>
						March 9, 2012<br/><br/></b>
						 
I recently started playing an MMO—Star Wars: The Old Republic. However, this post isn’t actually going to be about the game. It is going to be about two things a.) Playing on a PC and b.) The nature of the online gaming community.
<br/><br/>
Not only is this the first MMO I’ve ever played, it is the first PC game I’ve played that isn’t turn-based (Civilization). If you don’t know, MMO stands for Massively Multiplayer Online, and I must say, all aspects of the name are intimidating, but let’s cover one thing at a time.
<br/><br/>
<b>PC VS Console</b><br/>
I absolutely love playing on the PC. It is infinitely easier aiming with a mouse. At first I was overwhelmed by the amount of buttons, but as an avid hot-key enthusiast, they quickly grew on me.
<br/><br/>
Playing on the PC, I feel significantly more in control than with console games, but there is one thing I don’t like about it.
<br/><br/>
It takes a certain kind of person to sit at a computer desk for hours. In those flashes of load screen, you’re drawn back to reality as you look through your smudged glasses at the reflection of yourself in computer screen, hovering anxiously over your keyboard, Cheetos spilled out across the desk because your hand is too far away from the mouse when you have to reach into the bag.
<br/><br/>
Fortunately, you don’t really have time to examine your life decisions before the game loads again.
<br/><br/>
<b>The Community</b><br/>
This is the first time I’ve really interacted with guys pertaining to gaming who I wasn’t friends with, related to or dating.
<br/><br/>
I actually found myself very self-conscious, something I haven’t felt since that spiteful orthodontist rubber-banded my mouth nearly closed in high school.
<br/><br/>
I realized that I didn’t want them to think I was bad and perpetuate a stereotype that guys are better at video games than girls.
<br/><br/>
However, I gave it a shot and found two types of guys in the community.
<br/><br/>
<b>Type A</b><br/>
Midway through killing some fairly difficult monsters with my Sith Inquisitor, Susan (who will someday become Darth Susan), a guy came along and asked to join. I accepted, as the monsters were challenging. We successfully completed the mission, and just before I left the group, he asked if Susan was my real name.
<br/><br/>
After learning that while my name is not Susan, I am in fact a girl, his actions changed. Instead of helping me kill things, he started killing things for me. In fact, he ran ahead killing everything in sight before I could even get to it. My knight in shining armor, right? Wrong. Those were my droids. I wanted to kill those droids.
<br/><br/>
Type A guys want to protect you in the game and will often forfeit things they want and/or need simply because you are female.
<br/><br/>
<b>Type B</b><br/>
The second type of guy is the exact opposite of Type A. These are the guys who mock girls whether they’re talented or not. They spam the chat with sexist insults and specifically avoid girls when creating groups.
<br/><br/>
Although, I must make a confession. My companion’s name is Mako, but I often call her Makeup because she’s lame and doesn’t like the decisions I make, and just generally acts like a “girl.”
<br/><br/>
That being said, I suppose I can’t really blame Type B guys, as I laugh at their jokes and usually make them myself.
<br/><br/>
So what I’ve said here is a little unfair and probably sexist. Not all guys in game fit into Type A or B, but a lot do. I’m not sure why we can’t just play the game without gender biases. Speaking of gender biases:
<br/><br/>
<b>Where all the girls at?</b>
I have to be honest, I haven’t spent a lot of time scouring the game looking for girls; however, while playing, I’ve run across countless guys but not a single girl. Perhaps they too are nervous about ousting themselves as female gamers in such a male dominated activity.
<br/><br/>
Maybe the simple fact that I’m examining the game based on gender is sexist. Why should they proclaim their gender any more than a male? Nonetheless, I am interested in this issue and intend to find out just how many girls are playing and what they are playing.

							<label for="ac-23">Gaming from a girl’s perspective: Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas</label>
							<div class="article ac-extralarge">
							<p><b>Blog<br/>
							September 6, 2011<br/><br/></b>
							 
							I  have been very busy lately.
							<br/><br/>
							
							I escaped from Vault 101, saved people from super mutants, fought the enclave, purified the water in the Washington D.C. area, took a little break, was shot and almost buried alive, killed a legendary deathclaw, may have been responsible for the death of a centuries-old man and became vilified with the Legion.
							<br/><br/>
							I played through Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas for the first time. I played Fallout 3 on an Xbox 360 and New Vegas on a PS3. (I know. I know. I need to switch to PC.) Because these games are absurdly huge and full of content, this blog will just scratch the irradiated surface.
							<br/><br/>
							<B>What do I do?!</b><br/>
							It was the year 2277 when I took my first steps in the desolate American wasteland. I was confused and overwhelmed. The sheer vastness of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. was almost too consuming. I had no idea what I was supposed to do or where I was supposed to go. Mutated fire-breathing ants were crawling around to the southeast. Giant, intimidating horseshoe-crab-looking creatures lurked around an irradiated river, and scantily clad gangs with crazy hair ran around saying, “I’m going to tear you apart.”
							<br/><br/>
							This was my first experience with a non-linear game, and I must admit, I didn’t like it at first. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about though so I kept playing. At some point, I lost all recollection of time, 2011 and the real world. An hour turned into two, one quest turned into three, and before I knew it, I was totally addicted.
							<br/><br/>
							Because I was still so used to a linear style, I worked through a large part of the main quest line before I started roaming the wasteland aimlessly. Once I did, I realized why this game is so amazing.
							<br/><br/>
							My character’s name was Nellie Bly. She sported a hot-pink mohawk. With the name, I thought it was only appropriate that she collect cameras. I was a paragon… the last best hope for the wasteland.
							<br/><br/>
							<B>D.C. Superlatives</b><br/>
								&bull; Most Beautiful: After wandering what felt like millions of miles of the wasteland and not seeing any signs of vegetation, the obvious choice is Oasis. With a name like Oasis and luscious plant life, I assumed the area somehow avoided radiation. However, a name like mirage seems more appropriate since huge doses of radiation actually made Oasis possible. (I killed him by the way. I’m not sure what kind of person that makes me… Probably a terrible one… At least I didn’t burn him down.)<br/><br/>
								&bull; Best Dressed: The Enclave were the best dressed in the wasteland with their Tesla Armor. It could take the most damage, and it had crazy electricity shooting through it. I must say, however, I always loved the appearance of the black Talon Company armor.<br/><br/>
								&bull; Best Companion (besides DogMeat): I love Fawkes. She got in the way sometimes and killed things I wanted to kill, but for the most part, she was a great companion. I used the Star Paladin Cross, but not for long because a deathclaw killed her. That’s what she gets for standing in front of my gun… She learned a hard lesson that day. I used Charon for a while too but missed Fawkes. I didn’t include DogMeat, because I never travelled with him. It would have been too sad if something had killed him. He had a little area in my Megaton house with baseballs and dog bowls.
								&bull; Most Annoying: Little Lamplight. I wanted to shoot all of those little kids. Every. Single. One. They made it difficult to be a good character.<br/><br/>
								&bull; Best Weapon: I switched between the Terrible Shotgun, the Lincoln Repeater and a sniper rifle depending on the range, but I always liked the Terrible Shotgun the most. (I usually tried to get really close to enemies to compensate for my bad coordination.)<br/><br/>
								&bull; Most Scary: In Fallout 3, the deathclaws weren’t as scary to me as feral ghouls and the horrible sound they made when I was alone in the dark. However, it was not a feral ghoul that made me nearly jump off the couch. No, it was a mole rat. I turned around and it was just right there in my face. After that, I went on a mole rat rampage…

							Liberty Prime: I felt like the end of 3 was a little anticlimactic. I know, I should have thought Liberty Prime was epic, but I don’t know. I was kind of disappointed.
							<br/><br/>
							<B>Is that a bear trap?!</b><br/>
							I took a little break after 3 because of the way my brain started processing things. For example, I was driving home one night and there was an upside-down hubcap in the road. The first thought in my head was, “Is that a bear trap?” As soon as it popped into my mind, I knew I needed to take a break. I spoke with other Fallout addicts who had similar experiences–feeling their hand automatically move when seeing a manhole cover and fighting the urge to pick up bottle caps on the street.
							<br/><br/>
							<B>Fallout New Vegas</b><br/>
							I waited as long as I could before I started playing New Vegas (like two weeks). I was happy to immerse myself once again in post-apocalyptic America. Glitches in the game jerked me back to reality on several occasions, however. They sometimes resulted in a furious vow never to play again only to return 20 minutes later. The glitches must not have been that bad.
							<br/><br/>
							<B>This is different</b><br/>
							New Vegas has a lot more options and detail than Fallout 3. I was excited at first about the campfires, and reloading benches, but not super impressed with them during game-play. I felt like I never had all of the pieces I needed to make any one item with the campfires, and the gain doesn’t seem worth the amount of ammo you destroy on the reloading bench.
							<br/><br/>
							I really liked the different types of ammo, but there was never enough armor piercing. Obviously, I didn’t play in hardcore mode.
							<br/><br/>
							The deathclaws were absurdly more difficult to kill in New Vegas. After going to Dead Wind Cavern, I thought everything in the wasteland was a deathclaw. I froze and hid when I saw anything moving in the horizon–gecko or otherwise.

							<br/><br/>
							<B>Locations</b><br/>
							In the beginning, I kept my stuff in an abandoned house in GoodSprings. Once I got a house in Novac, I moved all my stuff there. (When I realized why it was named Novac, I was very amused.) But when I got the Presidential Suite, as a female, I obviously moved everything, again. I moved everything there and bought all the additions for the suite… like a girl. It wasn’t until I started using the suite that I realized how inconvenient it is. There are like three load screens between you and your presidential suite, not to mention you probably just fast travelled to the gate.
							<br/><br/>
							<B>Collections</b><br/>
							As I said before, I liked to collect cameras. I liked to kill things in the wasteland (despite my inferior hand-eye coordination), but I really liked to scavenge. I didn’t choose the explorer perk in Fallout 3, and I’m still sad about it. I only ended up finding like 150 of the 163 locations. I will obviously play it again at some point.
							<br/><br/>
							I collected Ant Nectar because it is pretty. I collected bears, but I surrounded them with something less lame: unique weapons. I collected cameras because my character's name was Nellie Bly. And, last but not least, I collected pool balls.
							<br/><br/>
							<B>The End?</b><br/>
							I chose the NCR ending, and was very happy with the excitement level while fighting my way to Lanius Legate. I was just getting warmed up when I lost control of my character due to a forced dialogue with stupid General Oliver telling me my work here is done. I couldn’t believe it. I wanted to go on to The Fort and take Caesar right that second. My boyfriend explained why I couldn’t kill Caesar in the end, and it made sense, but I’m still pouting.

						<label for="ac-24">Gaming from a girl’s perspective: Portal 2</label>
						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>Blog<br/>
						June 23, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						There is a reason I’ve only written one blog since school ended. On the last day of this crazy semester, I turned in the last story I will ever write, sat in my car in celebratory disbelief for about 10 minutes and then immediately went to buy Portal 2. That’s right. I’ve been playing games almost nonstop since then. Because all I’ve done lately is play games, this blog is going to be about games. However, I would like to preface it with a few statements for all the gamers who may read this:
						<br/><br/>
							I am not a "gamer." I just play games. You probably know more about it than I do.
							I don’t have great hand-eye coordination. You could probably beat me.
							I am very visual. You probably don’t care whether or not I think it is pretty.
						<br/><br/>
						For people unfamiliar with Portal, it is basically this absurd, hilarious, mind-bending, science adventure.
						<br/><br/>
						I went through Portal 2 fairly slowly, paying close attention to the incredibly detailed and malfunctioning test chambers and destroyed Aperture Science facility. I hope the Valve designers and writers are rolling in fat stacks of cash because they definitely delivered… again. The decaying test chambers add life both metaphorically and literally with encroaching, tropical-looking foliage to the formerly pristine chambers. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Despite the fact that there are only two other characters in the game, the spot humor and entertaining personalities of Wheatly and GLaDOS give the game a lot of energy. While Wheatly is amusing, GLaDOS’s sarcastic, witty and sometimes disturbing remarks will always come first in my heart. (Speaking of hearts, it made me smile to see the companion cube.) As a designer, I feel like I should also mention the amazing graphic design for Portal 2. The minimalistic work inside and outside the game is super creative.
						<br/><br/>
						It’s a good thing the game is so visually pleasing because the puzzles aren’t as challenging as I expected. There was never a moment when I threw my controller across the room in angry frustration, and the masochist in me really wanted that. (I played on an Xbox 360.) There was only one puzzle I couldn’t wrap my brain around. (It was Chapter 8 Chamber 16.) I understand the difficulty is probably set according to accessibility, but I feel like they could be a little more complex. Although, I have to say, the most frustrating aspect of Portal 1 for me wasn’t really the puzzle difficulty. It was the required hand-eye coordination. One of the greatest things about Portal 2 is it isn’t a clone of Portal 1 with new puzzles. They were brave enough to mix it up with new, wild tools. I loved that they stuck with the blue and orange of the portals for the gels, also.
						<br/><br/>
						Overall, I love the game. It is beautiful. The puzzles could be more challenging, but the distracting new environment compensates for it.

						<div class="article ac-small">
						<b><p>Column<br/>
						 January 31, 2012<br/><br/></b>
						 
						 About 7.6 million people tuned in to the season five premiere of "Jersey Shore" on Jan. 5.<br/><br/>

						That means 33 percent of all 18 to 49-year-olds in the United States watched Paul "Pauly D" Delvecchio learn a tough lesson about the seriousness of exfoliation combined with over tanning, which he described with the utmost medical wisdom as "burning his face off."<br/><br/>

						I'm not saying drama surrounding Ronnie's refusal to back "The Situation" in a fight at the club isn't interesting, but 7.6 million viewers puts "Jersey Shore" in the top ten shows on television in the United States, according to Nielsen, a global information and measurement company.<br/><br/>

						Reality show "American Idol" has been the number one primetime program in the United States for the past three years, leading "Jersey Shore's" premiere by about 25 million.<br/><br/>

						Season 11 of "American Idol" premiered on Jan. 18. That means 11 years of watching mostly mediocre singers fight their way to b-list stardom while the rest of the contestants intentionally humiliate themselves.<br/><br/>

						How much more can we possibly take?<br/><br/>

						While reality TV currently dominates the charts, don't let such a high audience number fool you. "American Idol" ratings have been on a steady decline since 2008. Last year, Nielson reported an average rating of 7.7, down from 15.5 in 2008, significantly lessening their lead on the market.<br/><br/>

						The light bulb of originality and creativity is burning out for reality TV.<br/><br/>

						We've watched detailed documentary-style reality shows about everything from pawn shops and truck drivers to makeup and cupcakes, and there isn't just one pawn shop, truck driver, makeup or cupcake reality show. There are several of each.<br/><br/>

						Originally, reality shows were inexpensive to produce compared to the cost and production of fiction and scripted shows, but inexpensive or not, how many "Big Brother" spiwn-offs can we really watch? How many seasons can over-tanned "Jersey Shore" stereotypes partying at a club and creating dumb acronyms like GTL really entertain us?<br/><br/>

						Networks have explored so many jobs and people for reality shows it's absurd. Maybe next we will relish in the dramatic, intense, intimate details of the lives of fast-food fry cooks in "Extreme Fry Cookers."<br/><br/>

						The declining ratings for some reality shows along with the popularity of shows like "The Walking Dead," "Game of Thrones," "Boardwalk Empire" and "The Good Wife," is the beginning of a shift and transformation in television that could severely reduce the number of reality TV shows we see on the main networks.<br/><br/>

						A few years ago, the cable channel AMC went mostly unnoticed by the general public, but after being nominated for nine Primetime Emmy Awards, 12 Saturn Awards, three Satellite Awards, one Golden Globe Award, eight Writers Guild of America Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards just for the show "Breaking Bad," people have started to take notice.<br/><br/>

						AMC's show "Mad Men" saw a 61 percent average increase in viewers from season three to season four, according to NewBay Media.<br/><br/>

						"The Walking Dead," another AMC show, has been wildly popular and the network's freshman series "Hell on Wheels," has also attracted attention.<br/><br/>

						Not only has the general public noticed the shows' popularity, the big networks have too.<br/><br/>

						While ABC still airs several reality shows including "The Bachelor," "Celebrity Wife Swap," "Extreme Makeover Home Edition" and "Shark Tank," ABC officials announced the launch of 13 new shows last May according to TV Guide, none of which are reality shows. Only eight of ABC's 29 primetime programs are reality shows.<br/><br/>

						Not only that, in September of 2011, ABC added "Pan Am," a period drama, no doubt in an attempt to match the massively popular period piece "Mad Men." NBC attempted the exact same thing with "The Playboy Club," another period piece, during the same season.<br/><br/>

						It was a strategic move for the networks considering the "Mad Men" season delay after the contract conflicts last year. Instead of choosing to produce a moderately inexpensive reality show, the networks chose fiction, most likely because they too observed the quickly increasing ratings for scripted shows.<br/><br/>

						CBS successfully jumped on the scripted train in 2009 just two years after the premiere of "Mad Men" and one year after the premiere of "Breaking Bad." "The Good Wife" has been a serious contender having been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards last year.<br/><br/>

						Unfortunately, based on the speedy cancellation of "The Playboy Club," some of the networks don't seem to understand that it isn't simply because it's a scripted show that it's popular.<br/><br/>

						Two main things separate shows like "Boardwalk Empire" from shows like "Grey's Anatomy."<br/><br/>

						The first problem with most network dramas is they are written with formulas that use cheap tricks to evoke emotion from audiences. The phrase, "low-hanging fruit" comes to mind.<br/><br/>

						The second thing that separates the shows is character development.<br/><br/>

						"Breaking Bad" follows the progression of Walter White's (Bryan Cranston) transformation from mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher to hardcore, murdering meth dealer.<br/><br/>

						At first, White is an anti-hero. He is doing awful things, but it's just to provide for his family so you make excuses for his bad behavior. However, as the show progresses, he simply becomes a villain. He is an incredibly complex character and ABC and NBC are having a difficult time establishing comparable characters.<br/><br/>

						However, it does seem like ABC is catching on and attempting to break their formulaic writing with their new hit show "Once Upon a Time." The premiere was the No. 1 entertainment show among 18- to 49-year-olds with 4.5 million viewers. The ratings increased by 16 percent with the second airing, according to an ABC press release.<br/><br/>

						It's a good thing they are attempting to shift gears as veteran shows like "Desperate Housewives" wrap up their last season and "Grey's Anatomy" slips in the ratings.<br/><br/>

						While the behemoth reality shows like "American Idol" still have a fairly loyal following, it might not be too far from now that we see fewer and fewer reality shows on the big networks and more beautifully written and produced, creative story telling. <br/><br/>

						<label for="ac-2">First in nation: Debate team members ranked No. 1</label>
						<div class="article ac-medium">
						<b><p>News<br/>
						 November 8, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						 Two members of the University debate team are ranked the No. 1 parliamentary team in the nation by the National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence.
<br/><br/>
Seniors Alex Warren, economics major, and Travis Smith, speech communication major are currently the top parliamentary debate team in America.
<br/><br/>
"I have high expectations for Alex and Travis," Dr. Charles "Chuck" Walts, debate coach and assistant professor of speech communications, said. "I believe they are two of the best debaters in the nation, and when they are firing on all cylinders, they can beat anyone."
<br/><br/>
Warren and Smith have already won 38 debate rounds this season.
<br/><br/>
"Over the past three years, we have been trying to create positive expectations," Smith said. "Now we have to meet those expectations. It's a good problem to have."
<br/><br/>
The debaters spend anywhere from 10 to 25 hours per week preparing. That doesn't include the time spent travelling and actually debating at tournaments.
<br/><br/>
The team usually leaves on Thursdays and returns on Mondays, spending their weekends debating at other universities around the nation.
<br/><br/>
University debate team members (from left) Travis Smith, Alex Warren, coach Dr. Charles Walts, Addison Gribbin and Dallas Flick, practice and review research on Nov. 3.
<br/><br/>
"All the hard work has paid off," Warren said. "We have finally proven we are competitive. We have made a name for ourselves."
<br/><br/>
The other half of the University debate team is Sophomore Addison Gribbin, English major, and freshman Dallas Flick, communications major. They are currently ranked 33 by NPTE.
<br/><br/>
"Addison and Dallas are progressing quickly," Walts said. "There is typically a large talent increase from a debater's first and second year. Addison is right where she should be and Dallas, being a freshman, is catching up fast."
<br/><br/>
Walts said debate is like a sport in that it is a linear progression. He said most people don't fully mature as debaters until they are seniors, but he expects Gribbin and Flick to receive an invitation to compete at the national tournament.
<br/><br/>
"Addison and Dallas have the talent to be in the top 25, so as the competitive season moves along I expect them to keep pace," Walts said.
<br/><br/>
The national parliamentary debate tournaments, National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence and the National Parliamentary Debate Association Championship Tournament, are scheduled for March 15-26.
<br/><br/>
"We want to win nationals," Warren said. "That's what you aim for every year, but it is more realistic this year considering where we are sitting."
<br/><br/>
The next tournament the team plans to compete at is Nov. 11 at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Walts said it is one of the toughest tournaments because schools usually only take their best teams.
<br/><br/>
"It's incredibly dense," Warren said. "Every round you're facing a good team."
<br/><br/>
Warren said the season has been more competitive than they expected.
<br/><br/>
"There are definitely a lot of good teams," he said. "We've been surprised by teams we didn't expect to be at the caliber they are competing at this year."
<br/><br/>
To prepare for their opponents, the teams do extensive research, participate in practice debate rounds and do speed drills, which involve reading aloud quickly and clearly to improve enunciation.
<br/><br/>
In addition to their usual preparatory activities, the team started filming their debate rounds this season.
<br/><br/>
"We watch the videos like a sports team," Warren said. "You don't notice what you're doing in the round, and Chuck can't watch every round. It allowed us to make improvements a lot more quickly."
<br/><br/>
Smith said they have committed a lot of time this year to progressing and videos have helped.
<br/><br/>
"We are probably more conscious of how to make better arguments during rounds," Smith said. "We have bridged the gap where we weren't viewing the debate round properly."
<br/><br/>
Despite the immense time spent on debate, Warren and Smith said it hasn't negatively affected their classes.
<br/><br/>
"Our professors have been very supportive of adapting to our needs," Warren said.
<br/><br/>
NPTE results include 19 tournaments and ranks 318 teams. <br/>

						<p><b>Review<br/>
						October 11, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						 By America's standards, I have horrible taste in television.
<br/><br/>
The nation's top five favorite TV shows are "Dancing with the Stars," "Modern family," "X Factor," "Grey's Anatomy" and "New Girl," according to this week's TV Guide's Most Popular TV Shows.
<br/><br/>
It wasn't until the 30s on TV Guide's list that my favorite show popped up. While I understand the addictiveness of "X Factor" (despite being almost exactly the same as "American Idol"), I think there are a few shows on TV right now that America is neglecting.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Boardwalk Empire" (Number 61 on TV Guide's list)</b><br/>
"Boardwalk Empire," directed by Martin Scorsese, is a period drama depicting historical criminal kingpins who spend their time drinking, gambling and killing during the 1920s and early 30s.
<br/><br/>
It is adapted from the book "Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times and Corruption of Atlantic City" by Nelson Johnson.
<br/><br/>
The main character, Enoch "Nucky" Johnson (Steve Buscemi), basically runs Atlantic City, New Jersey during the Prohibition Era. Other famous bosses, mobsters and just plain criminals in the show include Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg), Lucky Luciano (Vincent Piazza), and of course Al Capone (Stephen Graham).
<br/><br/>
Scorsese and Buscemi aren't the only famous names working on the show. Terence Winter, screenwriter and producer of "The Sopranos," created the series.
<br/><br/>
"Boardwalk Empire" has some of the darkest and most sincere character conflicts and struggles of any show in the last decade.
<br/><br/>
Some actions by Federal Prohibition Agent Nelson Van Alden (Michael Shannon) leave viewers shocked and horrified in season one, and he has not spared the cold brutality in season two.
<br/><br/>
The second season delves quickly into sinister race wars as Chalky White (Michael Kenneth Williams), a black bootlegger involved in organized crime, faces an all-out assault from the Ku Klux Klan involving automatic weapons and several deaths.
<br/><br/>
Certain circumstances surrounding the assault land White in jail where an epic scene leaves you disappointed you don't have a time machine that would allow you to join an organized crime family in the 20s.
<br/><br/>
"Boardwalk Empire" is also easily the most visually stimulating show on television right now, but it definitely came with a cost. The first episode cost $18 million and was the most expensive pilot episode in history, according to Variety magazine.
<br/><br/>
The show premiered in September of 2010 and HBO announced a second season of the show almost immediately. The second season premiered on Sept. 25, and will continue to run on HBO on Sundays at 9 p.m.
<br/><br/>
If you missed season one, Netflix has season one on DVD and plans to have season two. 
<br/><br/>
<b>"DEXTER" (Number 35 on TV Guide's list)</b><br/>
"Dexter" is a dramatic series following the life of mild-mannered Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), who is a blood-splatter analyst for Miami Metro Police Department. He also happens to be a serial killer.<br/><br/>

That isn't the only catch.<br/><br/>

He only kills bad guys, who he chooses based on a series of rules and standards set by his cop, adoptive father, Harry Morgan (James Remar).<br/><br/>

The show is rated mature for adult content, graphic language, graphic violence and brief nudity, so obviously, it's awesome. It is dark and super gory, however, character development is not lacking like with some violent shows ("Spartacus Blood and Sand").
<br/><br/>
The first episode of season six, which aired Oct. 2, introduces a new mass-murdering duo (Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks) who Dexter will undoubtedly face throughout the season.
<br/><br/>
The first episode revolves heavily around religion as Dexter contemplates enrolling his son in a Catholic school.
<br/><br/>
It may be a theme for the entire season considering the homicidal team introduced in the first episode uses biblical reference and scripture to support their murders.
<br/><br/>
It will be hard to top season four when John Lithgow joined the cast and owned the season, but the first crime scene in season six was pretty shocking.
<br/><br/>
The series debuted in October 2006. The show airs on Showtime at 9 p.m. on Sundays, but if you want to start from the beginning, Netflix has all five seasons.
<br/><br/>
You can also watch the episodes for a limited time on Showtime's website www.sho.com.

						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>Column<br/>
						May 3, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						As most of you know, we've had some problems here at the Patriot Talon this semester.
						<br/><br/>
						You've probably read the editorial on Page 1 and maybe even the story by Nathan Hardin, Student Press Law Center staff writer, but I wanted to take a second to comment from my point of view as editor in chief of the student newspaper and as a student, myself.
						<br/><br/>
						We are not doing this for attention or to create chaos.
						<br/><br/>
						We are doing it for newspaper staffs everywhere whom administrations have censored and shut down.
						<br/><br/>
						We are doing it for the students. We are your voice, your opinion and your thoughts, and we are fighting to ensure you are heard.
						<br/><br/>
						It is our responsibility as journalists to ensure the truth is revealed. It's often a thankless job, and sometimes people even criticize journalists for the information they uncover, but we are attempting to promote positive change.
						<br/><br/>
						We published the Feb. 22 editorial titled, "Secrets, secrets," not to create drama but to attempt to solve a problem.
						<br/><br/>
						It appears to me that this University is riddled with administrators who believe it is OK to operate in a completely closed environment.
						<br/><br/>
						That isn't a general, vague statement. I know because I have talked with many of you students.
						<br/><br/>
						I've listened to your problems and concerns, and as the editor of the student newspaper, I felt it necessary to at least attempt to fix some of those problems.
						<br/><br/>
						I have firsthand experience, as many of you do, with administrators who have been unsupportive and, at times, I believe condescending.
						<br/><br/>
						Many administrators withhold information, and, from what I've heard from students and faculty, administrators have been this way at the University for a long time.
						<br/><br/>
						After we published the article, not a single administrator approached me about the concerns printed.
						<br/><br/>
						I know they read the story because the newspaper stand in the Administration Building was always empty.
						<br/><br/>
						Well, they either read them or someone kept throwing them away.
						<br/><br/>
						Nonetheless, I was incredibly surprised when on April 18 the Patriot Talon adviser was fired.
						<br/><br/>
						To a student organization, an announcement like that is crushing.
						<br/><br/>
						For all the unnamed students who supposedly filed complaints, I would like for you to realize the repercussions of your actions.
						<br/><br/>
						I know some professors are hard; some make you think critically and reason, but what you've allowed to happen is so much bigger than that.
						<br/><br/>
						You've given University officials the opportunity to choose a new adviser who supports the same cyclical bureaucracy this University is so infamous for.
						<br/><br/>
						So, revel for a moment in the success of aiding in the dismissal of an educator with decades of experience and a love for journalism you can't even imagine.
						<br/><br/>
						As for the students and faculty who have and are supporting us, thank you.
						<br/><br/>
						Words cannot describe the appreciation and gratitude we owe to you.
						<br/><br/>
						I just hope we can return the favor by continuing to print your voice uncensored.

						<p><b>Editorial<br/>
						May 3, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						Editor's note: All statements made by the Patriot Talon editorial board regarding Dr. Dennis Cali, the University, and the Department of Communication are strictly the opinions of the editors. These claims have not been proven by a third party but are based on a fact-finding investigation and personal interviews and observations by the editors.
<br/><br/>
University officials fired Patriot Talon adviser Vanessa Curry on April 18, marking the most recent attempt to complicate the delivery of the student voice.
<br/><br/>
Dr. Dennis Cali, department of communications chair, cited egregious complaints from Patriot Talon staff members and students as the reason for dismissal.
<br/><br/>
After polling the staff, we found Cali did not talk to any current staff members about Curry's competency as a student adviser.
<br/><br/>
Cali didn't speak with Kamren Thompson, editor in chief; Andy Taylor, print managing editor; Lea Rittenhouse, Web managing editor; Hattie Kemp, opinion editor; Haley Bauman, art and entertainment editor; Jake Waddingham, sports editor; or any of our staff writers, including Jacob Bremer, Chris Brehmer, Tina Bausinger, Kelsey Wade, Rachael Roeten, Michael Hale, Lynn Dark, Derek Blain or Clay Ihlo.
<br/><br/>
It appears to us that Cali did not approach any of our staff members because we would have advocated for Curry to stay as our adviser.
<br/><br/>
Curry is not only an award-winning journalist but also an award-winning adviser as well. During the 11 years Curry served as adviser, the staff won about 175 awards at Texas Intercollegiate Press Association competitions.
<br/><br/>
There is no doubt in our minds the decision to fire Curry was made to punish and censor the Patriot Talon because of the Feb. 22 editorial titled, "Secrets, Secrets."
<br/><br/>
There seems to be concern that the Patriot Talon only prints what Curry wants to be said when, in fact, the staff is responsible for all the content.
<br/><br/>
She even refused to stay in the newsroom when we wrote the Feb. 22 editorial. Due to our recent TIPA accomplishments, including a historic Best in Show award, we believe officials should recognize the skills of the staff and Curry.
<br/><br/>
If anyone is unhappy with that editorial or anything else in the Patriot Talon, he or she should direct his or her complaints to the editor in chief.
<br/><br/>
University administrators have a history of grievances with the student newspaper because of our desire to publish the student voice, even when that voice calls into question actions that may reflect negatively on the University.
<br/><br/>
We believe the firing of our adviser is the culmination of a series of blatant attempts to the stifle student voice.
<br/><br/>
<b>NEWSROOM LOCATION: Attempt 1</b><br/>
In June of 2010, University officials informed the staff the newsroom would be moved to an undecided location. It was not until November that they chose a location and said we would be forced to move, despite initially saying it would be our choice.
<br/><br/>
After visiting the site, we respectfully declined for several reasons, including the following:
<br/><br/>
• The new site's location isolates us from the hub of campus activity. Since the newspaper's primary purpose is to inform the campus community, it should be nearer to the University Center.
• The distant location not only will discourage journalism majors from joining our staff but also will eliminate the benefit of faculty input.
• Uprooting the Patriot Talon headquarters from the communication department will be a detriment, stunting our growth and productivity as a collegiate publication.
<br/><br/>
On Feb 16, the Patriot Talon editorial board met with Cali and Dr. Ken Wink, College of Arts and Sciences interim dean, to discuss the issue. We decided to write a proposal to the Space Allocation Committee.
<br/><br/>
We submitted the proposal to Cali on March 2 per instructions from Wink given to Cali and Thompson.
<br/><br/>
Cali was supposed to give the proposal to Wink, who would submit it to the provost, who also serves as the committee chair. However, on March 25, Thompson met with Cali, who informed her he was unaware of his duty to pass on the proposal.
<br/><br/>
<b>BUSINESS COORDINATOR: Attempt 2</b><br/>
On Jan. 5, the Patriot Talon business coordinator resigned to take a position at the Tyler Morning Telegraph.
<br/><br/>
The business coordinator serves as an advertising adviser and helps sell almost 77 percent of his or her salary in advertising.
<br/><br/>
On Feb. 16, officials informed the staff we could not hire a new business coordinator due to budget constraints.
<br/><br/>
However, student fees are the source of funding for the Patriot Talon, which means the money can't be spent on anything other than student organizations and, therefore, is not subject to University budget constraints or hiring freezes.
<br/><br/>
Despite this, the University only approved the hiring of a part-time business coordinator, who works 19.5 hours per week at $11 per hour totaling about $11,000 a year.
<br/><br/>
We do not know where officials plan to allocate the remaining $9,000, but it legally must go to another student organization.
<br/><br/>
<b>ADVISER: Attempt 3</b><br/>
Despite the fact that Cali did not release the names of the students who made complaints, the Patriot Talon staff interviewed two former staff members who spoke with Cali. Former Patriot Talon staff photographer Jessica Sibbing said she felt Cali specifically sought out negative information about Curry.
<br/><br/>
We don't know the information Sibbing told Cali, but she told the Patriot Talon her responsibilities were what actually made her leave.
<br/><br/>
"I really liked working at the paper, and everything was fine with Ms. Curry on the Talon for the most part, mostly until the second half; we were really short handed," Sibbing said. "This wasn't her (Curry's) fault by any means," Sibbing said. "As photo editor, I ended up having to do three people's jobs, which wasn't my responsibility, and I wasn't paid any more for it through scholarships."
<br/><br/>
One former staff member who criticized Curry's advising ability asked to remain anonymous because she hopes to use Curry as a job reference in the future.
<br/><br/>
She said Cali asked her if having Curry as the adviser is bad for the Department of Communication.
<br/><br/>
"I just told Dr. Cali that when I did start with the Talon that she wasn't very welcoming to me, and it was very hard for me to get involved," she said.
<br/><br/>
However, this student said she left the department "not directly because of Curry but because of the journalism program as a whole." She said she was asked not to come back to the Patriot Talon at the end of the fall semester.
<br/><br/>
That is false.
<br/><br/>
Thompson gave every staff member a letter at the end of the semester to inform each of them of their new positions on staff.
<br/><br/>
The following is the letter, verbatim, Thompson gave the previously-mentioned, unnamed staff member: "I know how much you want the (name of position withheld to maintain anonymity) position, and I know what it means to you. Unfortunately, I just don't think you're quite ready for the responsibility on your own. I think one of the reasons you have a difficult time writing lengthy stories is because you aren't a writer. That's OK. I'm not a writer either, but you have so many amazing qualities that we are wasting and would continue to waste if I made you (name of position withheld to maintain anonymity). For example, you are great with people. You network better than anyone on staff. You like broadcast, and you like to go to events on campus and be involved. You would be much more beneficial on the multimedia side of the paper. Now, please don't get discouraged about the title. Jake and Andy were both promoted this semester. If I'm right about your skill set, and you continue to work hard and make some great videos this semester, we could create a multimedia position that is more suited to you and your skill set. I hope you understand and continue to work for the Patriot Talon. We need you."
<br/><br/>
To our knowledge, only one Patriot Talon editor has asked a staff member not to return to the staff. The 2006-2007 Patriot Talon editor in chief Erin Buller fired a photographer who was on probation for missing assignments.
<br/><br/>
He was given another chance, and Buller assigned him to cover George H. W. Bush's campus visit.
<br/><br/>
When this photographer missed the event, Buller fired him as a result. We would like to point out there are countless former Patriot Talon staff members who support Curry.
<br/><br/>
Former editor in chief of the Patriot Talon, Allen Arrick, who quit midway through the semester, now, believes Curry is one of the best newspaper advisers in Texas if not the country.
<br/><br/>
"Taking the Talon from a biweekly schedule to a weekly schedule really took its toll on all the members of the newspaper staff, especially Ms. Curry and myself," Arrick said. "We've since forgiven each other and are good friends." Arrick and said her success as an adviser is due to the fact that she is hard on her students.
<br/><br/>
Former staff member Travis Webb, who served on the Patriot Talon for four years, agreed.
<br/><br/>
"Vanessa Curry and I very rarely saw anything eye-to-eye," Webb said. "And, yes, she's tough and intimidating, she's also always been utterly dedicated to getting the best out of UT Tyler's student journalists."
<br/><br/>
"She was a tremendous adviser and a great champion of First Amendment rights. She taught me almost everything I know about journalism and a good deal of what I know about hard work," Webb said.
<br/><br/>
Arrick said he was not surprised by University officials' actions.
<br/><br/>
"The administration at UT Tyler has been trying to gut the newspaper for years," he said. "They've moved the Student Government Association to the top floor of the University Center while moving the Patriot Talon newsroom to a portable building at the back of the campus. It's insanely obvious."
<br/><br/>
Allie Abel, another former editor in chief of the Patriot Talon, said she was extremely shocked to hear University officials fired Curry.
<br/><br/>
Abel said she wanted to know why and what the reasoning behind her dismissal was.
<br/><br/>
"When I worked with her, she always did a great job," she said. "She was there for the students, helping however she could."
<br/><br/>
Abel said Curry really cares about the Patriot Talon and her students, and she works incredibly hard.
<br/><br/>
"This is a tremendous setback for the Patriot Talon," she said. "Curry wants to help prepare students for the real world. She doesn't want a program where everything is done for the students. She wants them to work hard and think for themselves."

						First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby in a baby carriage, right?
<br/><br/>
Wrong.
<br/><br/>
This is just one of the rhymes the fourth-graders taught us on the playground I recently realized is, in fact, false.
<br/><br/>
As I distractedly perused my Facebook friends last week, I noticed a startling trend among my young, unwed friends: babies.
<br/><br/>
The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2010 unwed mothers gave birth to almost half of American babies.
<br/><br/>
Don't get me wrong; babies are cute. I used to be a baby, but I just can't see any advantages to loud, dependent and expensive creatures.
<br/><br/>
MTV just finished the first season of "Teen Mom 2," which is a spin-off of "16 and Pregnant."
<br/><br/>
As you can guess, it is a fairly convoluted series documenting several teenage mothers as they literally create life.
<br/><br/>
Many of the teenagers' parents have to step in to help raise the babies, and some even take custody all together.
<br/><br/>
At the end of the show, many of the teen moms said they would have done things differently, implying waiting to have children.
<br/><br/>
What is it about their 16-year-old brains that make them believe they can or would want to provide for a child?
<br/><br/>
There aren't many benefits to being a single parent, other than always having something that is forced to love you.
<br/><br/>
Only 8 percent of single parents have a bachelor's degree or higher, and nearly half of single parents in the United States live in poverty, according the U.S. Census Bureau.
<br/><br/>
A study conducted by the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth stated children of adolescent mothers are significantly more likely to give birth before the age of 18.
<br/><br/>
Also, daughters of adolescent mothers are more susceptible to economic dependence and less likely to escape poverty.
<br/><br/>
Florida State University Center for Prevention & Early Intervention found children born to teen mothers are more likely to grow up in a poor, mother-only family, live in poor or underclass neighborhoods and experience high risks to both health status and potential school achievement.
<br/><br/>
It is a vicious cycle.
<br/><br/>
Young, unwed parents statistically don't continue their education, which puts them at a huge disadvantage in the job market.
<br/><br/>
Their children grow up in underprivileged environments, which is exactly the atmosphere from which many teenage parents come.
<br/><br/>
So, come on people. Break the cycle. Get a dog if you have to; just wait a while before you start producing the next generation of fourth-graders.

						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>Column<br/>
						March 29, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						I was checking newspaper e-mails the other day when I opened a message from a local newspaper editor complaining about a few errors in the Patriot Talon.
<br/><br/>
To be honest, the message got me a little down, but mostly I was amused because in the last sentence of the three-sentence message was a typo.
<br/><br/>
Are there errors in the paper? Of course, there are errors in the paper.
<br/><br/>
There may be an error in this column.
<br/><br/>
This is a student publication staffed with mostly full-time students who also have second jobs.
<br/><br/>
We are not perfect. We are here to learn. We don't intentionally make mistakes.
<br/><br/>
It seems quite a few people don't realize many of the "errors" they see are actually journalistic style.
<br/><br/>
It's called AP Style. The "AP" stands for Associated Press. We have a 419-page stylebook full of rules, such as the correct way to write "G-string" and the proper use of and differences in the words "assassin, killer and murderer."
<br/><br/>
I'm not kidding. G-string is in there.
<br/><br/>
Journalists have been developing this style since the first multi-cellular organism picked up a note pad and pen.
<br/><br/>
There is no clutter because, above all, we must save space.
<br/><br/>
Newspapers have a limited number of pages, and much of journalistic style hinges on that concept.
<br/><br/>
The first "AP Stylebook" came out in 1953, comprised of "thousands of suggestions and ideas, a stack of newspapers and a big dictionary," Tom Curley, AP president and chief executive officer, said in the "AP Stylebook" foreword.
<br/><br/>
AP Style dictates many things we write. For example, according to AP Style, it is "adviser" not "advisor."
<br/><br/>
It wasn't until the most recent edition of the book that "website" was changed from "Web site," despite the fact that most dictionaries said it should be "website."
<br/><br/>
We have our own abbreviation guide for states that differs from postal abbreviations.
<br/><br/>
The stylebook has a punctuation guide similar to "The Elements of Style" by E.B. White and William Strunk Jr., but it also differs quite a bit.
<br/><br/>
The most common example is when listing words, we never put a comma before "and."
<br/><br/>
It would be grammatically correct to hyphenate words beginning with "anti," but the stylebook lists 22 words beginning with "anti" that are not hyphenated like "antidepressant" and "antimony."
<br/><br/>
There is also a list of seven "anti" words that are hyphenated in direct contradiction to the dictionary, including "anti-social," "anti-aircraft" and "anti-bias."
<br/><br/>
Another example is "tee shirt," which appears first in the dictionary, while the correct AP style is "T-shirt."
<br/><br/>
Sometimes there are grammatical errors or maybe words used incorrectly in quotations.
<br/><br/>
A lot of debate about grammatical errors in people's quotes exists. Some journalists believe it is acceptable to correct grammar in quotations, but some do not.
<br/><br/>
Therefore, whenever a person literally says a grammatical mistake, many journalists believe it is more ethical to transcribe the mistake than change the words.
<br/><br/>
Now, maybe I'm being a little defensive here, but I think my editors deserve a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
<br/><br/>
It's not such an easy thing to learn a new writing style with so many very specific rules. It's even more difficult to switch back to an English style for classes because journalistic style is obviously far superior.
<br/><br/>
But, even after learning that, if you still believe we make too many mistakes, let me know. I love comments, even if they are negative and have typos.
<br/><br/>
I would like to point out, however, if you're going to leave an angry, upset comment about all the factual mistakes and biased journalism in the newspaper, please provide a few examples and your name.

						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>News<br/>
						March 29, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						The University debate team traveled to Oregon to compete in the National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence and the National Parliamentary Debate Association Championship Tournament March 7 to March 19.
<br/><br/>
The junior team, comprised of Alex Warren, economics major, and Travis Smith, political science and speech communication double major, finished 9th in the country, losing to the champion team from the University of Oregon.
<br/><br/>
"I am very pleased," debate coach Charles Walts said. "We did very well as newcomers to the national circuit. We are a young squad, and, like any competitive program, you can't go from zero to national champions. You have to build toward it."
<br/><br/>
Walts said the team made several large steps toward their national championship goal.
<br/><br/>
"We went from a program that only a few people knew about to one that garners respect and attention in the course of a year; that is no minor accomplishment," he said.
<br/><br/>
Warren said he expected the team to improve this year, but the "suddenness" of it surprised him.
<br/><br/>
"Last year, we were ranked in the 50s for much of the year and couldn't manage much consistent success," he said. "This year, we set the all-time record for wins in a season for our event, advanced to out rounds in 16 of 17 tournaments and consistently performed as one of the top-eight teams at each of those."
<br/><br/>
<b>National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence</b><br/>
NPTE consists of the top-64 teams in the nation of a total of 965 teams, Walts said.
<br/><br/>
At the tournament, Warren and Smith won eight out of the 12 preliminary rounds but lost the first two elimination rounds.
<br/><br/>
"At NPTE, the first tournament, we were still a little rusty, and, ultimately, this was probably what cost us," Warren said. "The layoff from the last tournament in February and NPTE in March is actually fairly significant in terms of skill atrophying."
<br/><br/>
Warren said they spent much of the time researching debate topics instead of literally practicing debate rounds.
<br/><br/>
"The time trade-off and the total amount of research we had to do was prohibitive," he said. "In spite of that, we developed some good strategies and executed them fairly well in most rounds."
<br/><br/>
Warren said NPTE "forces success to occur on the margins" because all of the competing teams are good.
<br/><br/>
"You have to have that extra leg up over the competition, and the smallest mistakes get magnified," he said. "We made a few too many small mistakes."
<br/><br/>
The freshmen team comprised of Addison Gribbin, an English major, and Mike Jones, an accounting major, finished as the top-freshmen team at the tournament.
<br/><br/>
"NPTE was a collection of the smartest college students in the nation, and I was proud just to be a part of it," Jones said. "As the only freshman-freshman team, we were congratulated by some of the most successful people in the debate community, which means so much to me."
<br/><br/>
Gribbin said she believes everyone on the team had a successful experience.
<br/><br/>
"Everyone was on their A game, and I got to learn a lot from seniors from other schools," she said. "I also was able to watch Alex and Travis debate and take some the elements that make them so successful and try to incorporate that into my rounds."
<br/><br/>
<b>National Parliamentary Debate Association Tournament</b>
<br/>
At the NPDA tournament, 150 parliamentary-debate teams from all over the nation compete.
<br/><br/>
Warren and Smith won six out of eight preliminary-debate rounds and won the first two elimination rounds against the University of Nebraska and Willamette University.
<br/><br/>
"By the second day of NPDA, we were in a fairly good rhythm," Warren said.
<br/><br/>
The win against Willamette University put Warren and Smith in octofinals against The University of Oregon team comprised of Hank Fields and Matt Gander.
<br/><br/>
"That win put us in octofinals against an Oregon team that had just won NPTE (that) would go on to win NPDA several hours later and had been in finals of nationals for three straight years," he said. "Even though we lost, we gave Oregon all they could handle, and Matt Gander pointed out that it was their hardest round of the season. I can live with that."
<br/><br/>
While the freshman team advanced in NPTE, they did not win the rounds necessary to continue at the NPDA tournament.
<br/><br/>
"In (NPDA) ... we were not as fortunate as we intended, but it would be an insult to be upset with the performance against the best parliamentary competition there is," Jones said. "I believe we made huge strides this season, being freshmen and doing as well as we did. I couldn't be prouder for the team, my partner or myself."
<br/><br/>
Overall, Jones said the tournaments were a positive experience.
<br/><br/>
"They (the tournaments) taught me that the debate community is a unique, caring and loving collection of some intellectual and beautiful people," he said. "I learned a lot overall and saw how the best debaters in the nation play the game."
<br/><br/>
<b>Next season</b>
<br/>
The team is excited about what this year's success means for the future.
<br/><br/>
"Alex and Travis will be back for their senior year and will be easily one of the top-five teams in the country next year," Walts said. "Addison and Mike will come back with more experience and will also be ready to step up and pose a double threat to teams. We have some growing and learning to do, but nothing that is out of our reach."
<br/><br/>
Jones said the tournaments gave him incentive and set a bar for next year.
<br/><br/>
"This year, both teams set a precedence for UT Tyler," Jones said. "It starts here. In a couple years, the University is going to be one of the best-overall, parliamentary-debate programs in the nation."
<br/><br/>
Warren said he is optimistic about next year.
<br/><br/>
"The second half of this semester demonstrated that we are a threat every weekend, and that's the kind of momentum we can build on," he said. "The freshmen will make a similar jump next year, I suspect, and they're going to be a very good team. This is an activity where reputation and momentum matter, and this season has positioned us well in both of those areas for the next year."

						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>Column<br/>
						March 14, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						I get high almost every day. It's usually a result of procrastination. I wait until the last minute to do a giant amount of work and become absurdly stressed out.
<br/><br/>
I usually finish the work just in time to turn in it in, and I get this incredible rush: a stress high.
<br/><br/>
Yeah, it probably isn't as cool as whatever you were thinking, but it's how I get my kicks, and I am completely addicted to the feeling.
<br/><br/>
A specific personality type feeds off the rush of stress.
<br/><br/>
Quite a few members of the Patriot Talon staff have that personality type, hence the stressful career choice.
<br/><br/>
Discovery Health states people with "Type-A" personalities are more prone to stressful situations.
<br/><br/>
They are typically rushed, impatient, ambitious, time-conscious, competitive and driven people.
<br/><br/>
Every year, we "Type-A" people sign up for too many activities, knowing what the result will be.
<br/><br/>
While I enjoy the high and feed off the addiction, it is probably about as good for me as a high from a socially-unaccepted drug like marijuana.
<br/><br/>
According to the Health Resource Network, stress contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure, strokes and many other illnesses because it decreases the immune system.
<br/><br/>
It also contributes to the development of alcoholism, obesity, suicide, drug addiction, cigarette addiction and other harmful behaviors.
<br/><br/>
As a result, tranquilizers, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications account for one-fourth of all prescriptions in the United States.
<br/><br/>
And to top it all off, stress actually makes you less intelligent.
<br/><br/>
According to "The Human Brain," a study conducted by The Franklin Institute in January, chronic stress floods the brain with powerful hormones that are only meant for short-term, emergency situations.
<br/><br/>
Continued exposure can damage, shrink and even kill brain cells.
<br/><br/>
It's amusing that while the effects of stress are so detrimental, most of society would simply pat me on the back and call me a hard worker.
<br/><br/>
Like most addicts, I likely will ignore the warnings and continue the abuse until one day when I'm strung out on a just-in-time-deadline, I will have a heart attack or something.
<br/><br/>
But hey, tell an employer you're addicted to stress or you're addicted to speed and see which one he or she responds to more negatively.

						<label for="ac-10">GUNS ON CAMPUS: Texas legislation may legalize weapons in classrooms</label>
						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>Column<br/>
						May 3, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						Students, faculty and staff may be able to carry concealed handguns on college and university campuses if Texas legislators pass Senate Bill 354.
<br/><br/>
Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, authored a concealed-handgun bill allowing owners to carry a weapon "on or about the license holder's person" while on campus.
<br/><br/>
Wentworth said in a CNN television interview on Feb. 23 that the bill is to increase self-defense, calling gun-free zones, "victim zones."
<br/><br/>
"How are you safe if you are sitting in a classroom unarmed, and some mentally-deranged person comes in and starts shooting people," Wentworth said in the interview.
<br/><br/>
University President Rodney Mabry did not comment on the potential law, but said the response from The University of Texas System Chancellor Franciso Cigarroa stood for UT Tyler.
<br/><br/>
Cigarroa sent a letter to Gov. Rick Perry speaking against the legislation, citing parent, student, faculty, mental-health professionals and law-enforcement concerns.
<br/><br/>
"I must concur with all the concerns and apprehensions expressed to me, that the presence of concealed weapons, on balance, will make campus a less safe environment," Cigarroa said in the letter.
<br/><br/>
However, criminal-justice major Jordan Baker said he fully supports the legislation.
<br/><br/>
"When I was first reading into this possible change, I got extremely excited because I am a concealed-permit owner," Baker said. "I feel that it would make campus a little safer."
<br/><br/>
As of 2008, laws in 26 states prohibit guns on public campuses while 23 states have discretion over the choice, and only Utah prohibits state institutions from barring guns on campus, accordaccording to the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.
<br/><br/>
Cathy Cline, a senior biology major, said she believes people should have the right to carry guns anywhere if they have a permit.
<br/><br/>
"I think it's weird to have a permit to carry a gun but have places you can't carry guns," Cline said. "You either should be able to or shouldn't be able to." Josh Carroll, a freshman biology major, said the legislation would not make him feel safer.
<br/><br/>
"I think it's really unnecessary for students to have guns," Carroll said. "There is not a legitimate reason to carry a gun on campus. I would definitely not feel safer."
<br/><br/>
Brandon Voss, a junior kinesiology major, also doesn't support the legislation but would pursue a concealed-handgun license to prevent being defenseless after the legislation passes.
<br/><br/>
"Guns don't need to be in a classroom," Voss said. "It's not for a learning environment; but if I walk into a classroom, and 15 other people have guns, and I don't, I would be defenseless."
<br/><br/>
Section 46.03 of the Texas Penal Code currently prohibits weapons on the premises of a school or education intuition, polling places, court offices, racetracks, airports and prisons.
<br/><br/>
Wentworth said the Texas Senate passed the bill in 2009, and the bill had the votes to pass in the Texas House of Representatives, but the session ended before representatives could vote.
<br/><br/>
"We have more support in the House this time," he said. "I'm pretty sure the bill will be passed and signed by the governor in about the next month or so."
<br/><br/>
Under Wentworth's law, private schools would have the ability to choose to abide by the law after consulting with students, faculty and staff, but public universities would not have that opinion.
<br/><br/>
Dr. Mary Linehan, University history professor, does not support the legislation.
<br/><br/>
"Guns increase violence, never lower it," she said.
<br/><br/>
Linehan said the confusion during a shooting can escalate with the presence of more weapons, citing the recent incident in Tuscon, Arizona, when suspect Jared Loughne allegedly killed six people and wounded 13, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
<br/><br/>
"Shoot first, think later is not a safety precaution," she said.
<br/><br/>
Dr. Barbara Hart, criminal justice department interim chair, said while campus shootings are rare, students reacting physically and mentally in varying degrees due to the stresses of college and life is very common.
<br/><br/>
"When you add the fact that the common age for college students is about 19 to 24, you have young individuals with limited-life experience facing enormous problems," Hart said. "Almost all instructors personally know of these inner-most struggles suffered by their students, and, now, you ask if instructors are in favor of these students having weapons while they are being graded by that instructor."
<br/><br/>
Linehan said she was a professor at Grand Valley State University in Michigan in the early 1990s when two students working on a project for class got into a dispute. She said one student had a legally-concealed weapon and shot and killed the other student.
<br/><br/>
"As an educator who has dealt with student emotions, I would be afraid to pass back papers if students could be carrying guns," she said.
<br/><br/>
However, Wentworth said in the CNN interview, people do not go through the licensing process lightly.
<br/><br/>
Texas state law requires applicants have 10 hours of class or gun-range training, pass a handgun-proficiency exam and be at least 21 years old to obtain a license. Wentworth said less than 2 percent of Texans have the license.
<br/><br/>
Wentworth said students with the proper training and permits would better be able to defend themselves and others.
<br/><br/>
Baker agreed with Wentworth.
<br/><br/>
"The biggest contradiction to this law I have heard has been that the students would be able to just carry openly," Baker said. "This is extremely false and for those of us that have paid our money and taken the 10-hour class, it seems a little ridiculous that we can carry everywhere else in the state to protect those around us and ourselves; yet in school, we can't."
<br/><br/>
However, Hart said while a student successfully stopping a shooter is possible, she believes it is not probable.
<br/><br/>
"Note the Fort Hood situation, but that was stopped by a trained officer," she said. "These shootings occur with no warnings - no time to prepare - and are usually over in a matter of minutes if not seconds," she said.
<br/><br/>
Hart said she believes not many people, even those with the 10 hours of training, could successfully confront the shooter and, at the same time, avoid shooting innocent people.
<br/><br/>
"The justification that all students should or could have guns on campus, in order to stop such a shooting, may be idealistic rather than realistic," she said. "There is some research that suggests that the potential for gun violence may be reduced if the shooter has reason to believe anyone else present may also have a weapon. However, that hypothesis is difficult to test."
<br/><br/>
Anthony Emmel, University history instructor, said the age limit would rule out many of the younger students, and the bill should only allow faculty and administration to carry weapons.
<br/><br/>
Emmel said he could see both positive and negative aspects.
<br/><br/>
"I can see the potential to protect one's self after night classes as a positive," he said. "But I think it is a sad comment on our society that it is even necessary to still have the need to carry weapons."
<br/><br/>
All but one of the students interviewed said they don't believe the threat of students and faculty with guns would stop most school shooters.
<br/><br/>
"I wouldn't feel safer because I wouldn't carry one myself," Cierra Cline, a freshman psychology major, said. "And I don't think it would deter a shooter because a person that is going to shoot someone is psychologically off. So, they may think of it as a challenge."
<br/><br/>
Josh Ware, a sophomore English major, also said he didn't believe the legislation would deter a gunman.
<br/><br/>
"If someone is going to do that, they will do it anyway," Ware said. "They probably want their life to be ended anyway. It's not about being afraid."
<br/><br/>
Ware said he would be concerned about accidents as a result of the legislation.
<br/><br/>
"What if someone loses track of their gun on campus?" he said.
<br/><br/>
Beayonka Askew, a senior health-studies major, said she would also be concerned with regulation and whether campus-security personnel would check licenses.
<br/><br/>
Askew said school shootings are usually isolated incidents, and she believes campus-security personnel do a good job keeping the campus safe.
<br/><br/>
"I don't know if we would necessarily needs firearms," she said. "We have campus security, and they make rounds often.
<br/><br/>
In addition to Chief Mike Medders, there are eight officers and six security guards, and campus security officials said officers are constantly patrolling campus.

						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>News<br/>
						February 10, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						Two more district court judges indicted the men who received multiple life sentences in Smith County for burning East Texas churches last year.
<br/><br/>
Henderson and Van Zandt County district court judges indicted Jason Robert Bourque, 20-year-old former University student, on six counts of arson.
<br/><br/>
Daniel McAllister, 22, received indictments on two counts of arson in Henderson County and three counts in Van Zandt County.
<br/><br/>
In Smith County, Judge Christi Kennedy found Bourque guilty of five counts of arsons and three counts of attempted arson.
<br/><br/>
Kennedy found McAllister guilty of two counts of arson and two counts of attempted arson.
<br/><br/>
Bourque must serve the five life sentences and two 20-year sentences concurrently, before serving a third 20-year sentence, all of which are the maximum sentences for the crimes.
<br/><br/>
McAllister must serve two life sentences and two 20-year sentences concurrently.
<br/><br/>
Both men also must pay restitutions for the crimes, to be set at a later date.
<br/><br/>
Kennedy considered previous criminal records when deciding whether to accept the state's maximum sentence recommendations.
<br/><br/>
Court documents connected Bourque to a sexual assault on Feb. 6, 2009 at University Pines Apartments.
<br/><br/>
The report stated Campus Police received a complaint of a 19-year-old student engaging in sexual activity with a 15-year-old.
<br/><br/>
"We worked the case and submitted it to the district attorney's office and, of course, after that he got arrested," Police Chief Mike Medders said.
<br/><br/>
In the Smith County hearings, the judges gave each victim of the arsons a chance to speak to witnesses, as part of a victim-impact statement. Initially, three victims planned to speak, but one canceled prior to the hearing.
<br/><br/>
Pastor David Martin of Pinebrook Baptist Church offered hope to the two church arsonists.
<br/><br/>
"I come with a heavy heart," Martin said. "Our church has prayed for you, and we forgive you."
<br/><br/>
Dwight Lawson, pastor of Clearview Baptist Church, also issued a final statement to the two men.
<br/><br/>
"I've been praying for you," Lawson said. "I offer myself to you if there's anything I can help you with."
<br/><br/>
Providing an analogy to Solomon, who persecuted churches in the Bible, Martin spoke about how God forgave Solomon, who later became a missionary. "Get on your knees, like I'm sure you already have, and ask God's forgiveness," he said. "He can use you in a mighty way."
<br/><br/>
During a plea hearing on Dec. 15, the prosecution dropped deadly-weapon charges, which means the defendants could be eligible for parole sooner.
<br/><br/>
The Smith County court found Bourque guilty of the following charges:<br/>
• Arson - Jan. 16 Tyland Baptist Church located at 2818 Silver Creek Drive in Tyler<br/>
• Arson - Jan. 17 1st Church of Christ Scientist located at 106 East Second Street in Tyler<br/>
• Arson - Jan. 20 Fellowship of Prairie Creek Church located at 2401 South Main Street in Lindale<br/>
• Arson - Feb. 8 Clear Spring Missionary Baptist Church located at 14914 CR 426 in Lindale<br/>
• Arson - Feb. 8 Dover Baptist Church located at 21166 FM 1995 in Tyler<br/>
• Attempted arson - Feb. 7 Heritage Baptist Church located at 7720 S. Broadway in Tyler<br/>
• Attempted arson - Feb. 8 Pinebrook Baptist Church located at 3606 Van Highway in Tyler<br/>
• Attempted arson - Feb. 8 Clearview Baptist Church located at 13933 State Highway 110 North<br/><br/>
The court found McAllister guilty of the following charges:<br/>

						<label for="ac-12">Cable TV takes on the zombie apocalypse</label>
						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>Review <br/>
						February 8, 2011<br/><br/></b>
						 
						The zombie apocalypse has spread. An undead plague has claimed yet more victims. Fans have never been happier. AMC's "The Walking Dead" is a hit.
<br/><br/>
The show, based on a comic book of the same name, follows the life of a county sheriff from Georgia after most of humanity has either been killed by or joined an army of lifeless zombies.
<br/><br/>
AMC executives confirmed a 13-episode second season but have yet to release an airdate.
<br/><br/>
They plan to start production of the second season this month.
<br/><br/>
The show, produced by Frank Darabont (director of "The Shawshank Redemption"), is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Robert Kirkman.
<br/><br/>
The series follows the survivors of a zombie apocalypse, as they fight to stay alive after the undead destroy civilization.
<br/><br/>
Writers definitely don't delay the first zombie appearance. Viewers get an in-your-face look at one of the walking dead almost immediately, and it is a bloody, mangled, little girl, no less.
<br/><br/>
Fans of the comic series may be enthralled to witness scenes pulled right off the page.
<br/><br/>
But, at times, the focus on action and special effects leads to less-than-stellar character development from main character Sheriff Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his friend and partner, officer Shane Walsh (Joe Bernthal), when the episode flashes back to better, less zombie-filled times.
<br/><br/>
While the show is about the undead destroying civilization, it is also about humanity and the lives of the survivors.
<br/><br/>
There is a large emphasis on interaction and relationships throughout the six-episode season, and each episode definitely gets better as the season progresses.
<br/><br/>
The show questions the laws and morals of the surviving society while the world collapses socially, financially and directorially.
<br/><br/>
Through a series of events in the first episode, Grimes is hospitalized and wakes up from a coma to find a viral outbreak has started the zombie apocalypse, disappointingly similar to the 2002 zombie movie, "28 Days Later."
<br/><br/>
However, the hospital, like almost all of "The Walking Dead" sets, is perfectly creepy, complete with flickering lights and half-eaten corpses. I would imagine if zombies ravaged the world in real life, it would look like the set of "The Walking Dead."
<br/><br/>
Grimes searches the desolate town for his wife (Sarah Wayne Collins) and son (Chandler Riggs) but instead finds survivors who inform him of the post-apocalyptic world and the classic zombie rules.
<br/><br/>
For the people who don't know the traditional zombie policies, it starts with a bite. Then the person develops an illness trademarked by a fever. They die and the virus reanimates them as flesh-eating monsters.
<br/><br/>
Directors have produced a number of types of zombies throughout horror-movie history.
<br/><br/>
The undead in this show don't have super speed, but they aren't necessarily slow.
<br/><br/>
They do seem to keep some remnants of memories but can't communicate. Noise attracts them, which means hand-to-hand combat is a necessity-no gunfire.
<br/><br/>
After getting the apocalypse low-down, Grimes travels to Atlanta where he believes the military has created a safe haven.
<br/><br/>
While he doesn't quite find what he's looking for, he does find survivors, who attempt to live as normally as possible, including not being torn apart by zombies.
<br/><br/>
The survivors find some relief and a few answers in the last episode of the season, but it is short-lived and shallow.
<br/><br/>
The season ends with the characters disappointed, uncertain and troubled but still together.

						December 17, 2010<br/><br/></b>
						 
						Two men charged with burning East Texas churches earlier this year face a possible life sentence after pleading guilty Wednesday.
<br/><br/>
Jason Bourque, 20-year-old former University student, pleaded guilty to five counts of arson and two counts of attempted arson.
<br/><br/>
District Attorney Matt Bingham recommended Bourque pay restitution and serve the maximum sentence of life in prison for five arson charges.
<br/><br/>
If the court agrees to the recommendations, Bourque must serve the five life sentences and two 20-year sentences concurrently before serving the third 20-year sentence.
<br/><br/>
Daniel McAllister, 22, pleaded guilty to two counts of arson and two counts of attempted arson.
<br/><br/>
Bingham recommended McAllister also pay restitution and serve the maximum sentence of life in prison for each arson charge and 20-years for the attempted arson charges, which he must serve concurrently.
<br/><br/>
In the agreement, the prosecution dropped the deadly weapon charges, which means they could be eligible for parole sooner.
<br/><br/>
Judge Christi Kennedy scheduled the official sentencing for 8:30 a.m. for Bourque and 9:30 a.m. for McAllister on Jan. 10 at in the 114th District Court. If the court agrees to the recommendation or sets a shorter sentence, the defendants will have limited right to appeal, Kennedy said.
<br/><br/>
The maximum sentence for each arson count is life in prison and a minimum sentence of 5 years in prison.
<br/><br/>
The maximum sentence for each attempted arson count is 20 years in prison and a minimum of two years in prison.
<br/><br/>
Bourque and McAllister committed all of the arsons in February and January of 2010.
<br/><br/>
Bourque pleaded guilty to the following charges:<br/>
Arson - Jan.16 Tyland Baptist Church located at 2818 Silver Creek Drive in Tyler<br/>

						<p><b>	Review <br/>
						December 9, 2010<br/><br/></b>
						 
						"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1" is the beginning of the end for the widely successful movie adaptation.
<br/><br/>
The movie is the first part of the last installment of J.K. Rowling's famous Harry Potter book series, and director David Yates does a great job following the sequence of the book.
<br/><br/>
The first scenes bring viewers to the Ministry of Magic, where the sinister tone of the movie is set.
<br/><br/>
Soon after, we meet the leading trio, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), followed quickly by a slew of main characters, including the Weasley twins (James and Oliver Phelps), Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody (Brendan Gleeson), Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) and the villain, Lord Voldemort (Ian Hart).
<br/><br/>
With this, the trio's horcrux hunt begins, as the rest of the wizarding world tries to stay out of the crosshairs of or fight against the Death Eaters, who basically have taken over the Ministry of Magic.
<br/><br/>
I was pleased to again see one of my favorite character translations ever, Dolores Umbride (Imelda Staunton). Staunton did a phenomenal job bringing Umbridge to life in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," and continues to perfect her on-screen personality.
<br/><br/>
Some have criticized the series for being too dark for its intended audience, but the dramatic, ominous tension really makes this movie.
<br/><br/>
One of the darkest scenes takes place at Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bohnam Carter) may have been torturing Hermoine, but she definitely does not torture the audience with her stellar performance.
<br/><br/>
The same cannot be said for poor Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Even after acting in six other Harry Potter films, he is still the worst actor known to man, wizard or muggle.
<br/><br/>
Most of the other young actors seem to find their places in the dramatic roles, but at times it seems like they were too focused on the drama, failing at most of the humor. A majority of it seems forced and unnatural.
<br/><br/>
The film does an acceptable job balancing the horrible events going on in the wizarding world and the characters' attempts to continue living normal, somewhat happy lives.
<br/><br/>
One thing this movie definitely has over the previous ones is special effects. It is by far the most visually pleasing Harry Potter movie. There were a few instances of less than impressive special effects, but as a whole, it was a very striking film.
<br/><br/>
A specific visually appealing scene is the recounting of "The Tale of the Three Brothers and the Deathly Hallows." Instead of keeping it live action, the film creators chose an animated sequence narrated by Hermione. At first, I was skeptical, but as I watched, I really enjoyed the animation.
<br/><br/>
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the movie is its adaptation of the book. It can't be simple to make a 759-page book with crazy, expensive-to-bring-to-life magic into two movies.
<br/><br/>
This book specifically must have been difficult because quite a few of those 759 pages follow the trio, as they pout in the forest, trying to think of a plan to defeat the Dark Lord.
<br/><br/>
Overall, the adaptation, visualizations and acting make "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1" the best of the eight-part series. The eighth and final movie, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2," is set for release in July.

<br/><br/>
Team members furiously transcribe their opponent's argument, as the stopwatch runs down, and junior Travis Smith raises his hand to call a point of order.
<br/><br/>
The typical parliamentary-debate round lasts about 45 minutes and is a combination of six speeches, lasting four to eight minutes. Two teams with two members debate a resolution for which they have 20 minutes to prepare.
<br/><br/>
These 45-minute rounds are a culmination of hours of research, training, travel and preparation for the University's four-member debate team.
<br/><br/>
The team is made of two freshmen, English major Addison Gribbin and accounting major Michael Jones, and two juniors, economics major Alex Warren and Smith, political science and speech communication double major.
<br/><br/>
"We are not average people, especially because we public speak for fun," Gribbin said. "It's what we were born to do. It's thrilling. You're nervous, but you're excited. It's a really quick pace, and you're on edge. It's nothing that can be imitated."
<br/><br/>
Warren said the goal for the semester is both teams get bids to compete in the national tournaments.
<br/><br/>
Currently, the team is the only team in the nation to get bids to all three round-robin tournaments, and Warren and Smith have won more rounds than any other team in the nation has debated.
<br/><br/>
Coaching the team, Dr. Charles "Chuck" Walts, assistant professor of speech communications, started debating at Abilene Cooper High School. He said participating in debate teaches unparalleled skills.
<br/><br/>
"I like strategizing about arguments and manipulating those arguments on the playing board of debate," he said. "We are always on the cutting edge of any news event or development around the world."
<br/><br/>
The team members said they give a lot of the credit for their success to Walts.
<br/><br/>
"As a coach, he is actually our primary advantage over other teams," Warren said. "The fact that we are this competitive is really just because Chuck is incredibly brilliant. It's a little bit mind blowing to me how consistently he can anticipate what the others teams are going to do and prepare us for that and the strategies he can come up with."
<br/><br/>
Jordan Innerarity is the team's graduate assistant coach. He debated for the University last semester after debating for Lindale High School and Tyler Junior College.
<br/><br/>
"I joined the UT Tyler debate team because I love the activity," Innerarity said. "I have learned a lot from Chuck, and I knew when I graduated last May I had more to learn."
<br/><br/>
Walking into the debate room, one might think the tightly-packed trophy case had exploded, as about 30 trophies sit atop almost every available surface. Another unexpected sight sitting in the corner of the room is the large cream-colored sofa overlaid with blankets and pillows.
<br/><br/>
The debaters practically live in the room, spending an average of 10 to12 hours every week preparing for tournaments.
<br/><br/>
The team sits at the large conference table, scattered with debate files, at least once a week to discuss assignments and upcoming tournaments.
<br/><br/>
The team travels to tournaments on Thursdays and returns on Mondays throughout the semester. Preparation for the competition takes extensive research and training, in addition to the time actually spent at tournaments.
<br/><br/>
Warren said he spends three to four hours per day preparing for the 45-minute rounds.
<br/><br/>
"We try to be more informed than other teams on most issues," Warren said. "Specifically in things we have an advantage in anyway. I'm an economics major, so I would find it kind of embarrassing if I didn't have a better idea as to the unemployment level."
<br/><br/>
The team members also practice speaking speed drills, which train them to enunciate and speak more clearly and quickly.
<br/><br/>
"A lot of it is just reading news articles as quickly as you can, and you can read it backwards or read it with the word 'wow' or 'o' or 'u' (after each word) or put a pencil in your mouth and read," Gribbin said. "It's to help you enunciate. It's teaching and training your mouth to speak quickly and clearly for a long amount of time."
<br/><br/>
It is necessary to speak quickly in order to make as many arguments as possible in the allotted time, which ranges from four to eight minutes.
<br/><br/>
Despite the immense amount of time the team members dedicate to the competition, none of them said they regret the choice.
<br/><br/>
"I feel like people that are actually committed are born to do it because it takes so much commitment," Gribbin said. "Debate is a sport. We compete just like any other sport, only we don't tackle people. It would be kind of nice if we could though."
<br/><br/>
Jones said the time commitment is necessary.
<br/><br/>
"If you want to be great at the game, then you have to put the time in it," Jones said. "I think I could probably get away with debate and not put the time in it that I am. I just wouldn't be good."
<br/><br/>
Traveling is one of largest time expenditures for the team members, who have traveled about 13,000 miles this semester.
<br/><br/>
"I'm tired of airports," Warren said. "I don't like going through security. I don't like planes. I'm tired of peanuts. That part takes a toll. There are definitely downsides to this. I am still very pleased with it, regardless. It's still worth the tradeoff for me."
<br/><br/>
However, the debaters aren't the only ones preparing for tournaments. Walts spends hours researching the topic areas, in addition to organizing the team's traveling plans and practice schedules.
<br/><br/>
Innerarity also assists the team by helping Walts organize travel paperwork, practice rounds and research assignments. He also judges debate rounds at the tournaments.
<br/><br/>
"I basically do whatever is needed to be done to ensure we are well-prepared for the tournaments," Innerarity said.
<br/><br/>
Another issue that affects time commitment is the size of the team, which is relatively small compared to some competitors. Warren said a drawback to its size is research limitations.
<br/><br/>
"In some ways, it puts us in a disadvantage," Warren said. "There are teams like Washburn that roll 30 people deep, and we are working research assignments during the week. There is going to come a time in the season where I'm going to be writing 100 to 200 pages a week; whereas at Washburn, they will be writing 10-20 pages a week."
<br/><br/>
However, Walts said he is happy with the size of the team.
<br/><br/>
"I like a small tight-knit squad," Walts said. "For us, it's primarily a logistics concern. We have a problem in that our location doesn't lend itself to a large team. The more people I have, the prices go up exponentially. Also, the more people you have, the more time it takes to practice."
<br/><br/>
Walts has experience with teams of various sizes in his 11 years of coaching experience.
<br/><br/>
After graduating from Abilene Cooper High School, Walts continued to debate at Abilene Christian University, where he received his graduate degree. He received his master's degree at Eastern New Mexico University, while serving as graduate assistant coach for the debate team.
<br/><br/>
He also served as graduate assistant coach at Southern Illinois University, where he completed his doctorate. Walts last taught at William Jewell College before coming to the University in 2009.
<br/><br/>
"It's an activity that brings me a lot of satisfaction and personal fulfillment," he said. "It's the only game that truly puts one person's wits against someone else's. This (game) is based on your ability to create."
<br/><br/>
Like Walts and Innerarity, all of the team members started debating in high school.
<br/><br/>
Gribbin attended Ennis High School, and Jones attended North Lamar High School in Paris. Smith attended Palestine High School, and Warren attended Robert E. Lee High School in Tyler.
<br/><br/>
"Debate in high school was one of the few opportunities to engage in an academic competition against people external to my school, which was probably why I did it," Warren said. "I wanted more people to beat, which is why I'm competing now-the broadest possible pool to measure myself against."
<br/><br/>
Every member of the gregarious team is pursing a career that benefits from debate.
<br/><br/>
Gribbin wants to go into a facet of law.
<br/><br/>
"In a courtroom, if I'm defending someone, I need to be able to predict what they're going to say," Gribbin said. "It's for critical thinking and being able to produce well-thought-out arguments quickly."
<br/><br/>
Jones said he hopes to be a Certified Public Accountant, and the research he does for debate supplements his knowledge of accounting and world affairs.
<br/><br/>
Smith, who is probably the most social of the team, appropriately plans to go into foreign diplomacy or politics.
<br/><br/>
"It's helped with communication skills obviously, being able to persuade people without being aggressive," Smith said. "It's also helped me to meet a lot of people in areas where I can grow. I can build connections."
<br/><br/>
While Warren is considering developmental economics or business administration, he is also entertaining the idea of being a debate coach, which seemed fitting during the numerous times he spoke proudly of the freshmen team's success.
<br/><br/>
Innerarity plans to get a doctorate degree in speech communication and is also considering becoming a debate coach.
<br/><br/>
Like a family
The hours the debaters spend practicing in the debate room, waiting for flights and eating at very specific gas-station barbecue restaurants has created a strong bond among them.
<br/><br/>
"I like how it's a small group of us," Jones said. "I think that's important because it's like a family. We are really close. We spend virtually every weekend together and upon that, we have practice within the week. We see each other on a daily basis."
<br/><br/>
Walts agreed the current team is very close.
<br/><br/>
"They are really tight," Walts said. "They develop their own jargon and jokes and way of acting around each other that are different. They really do care about what happens to each other."
<br/><br/>
He said as a result of the time the team members spend together, they have formed a number of quirks and inside jokes.
<br/><br/>
"In case you haven't noticed, we all have a few odd little quirks," Gribbin said. "We are an odd bunch indeed."
<br/><br/>
One example of this is the "ugly hat."
<br/><br/>
The member that gets the fewest speaker points, which are given by judges during rounds for various speaking skills, has to wear a brown-and-white beanie with rainbow trim.
<br/><br/>
"I feel like it is a good mechanism to motivate me to better my speaker points because it's a nuisance to have to keep up with it and wear it, and people say it's ugly," Gribbin said.
<br/><br/>
Walts said the hat motivates the team to succeed.
<br/><br/>
"The ugly hat is an inducement to perform better," he said. "If you don't want to wear the hat, you debate better."
<br/><br/>
An example of one of the team's inside jokes has to do with honey badgers, described by Warren as a terrifying, organic, killing machine that destroys anything in its path.
<br/><br/>
"The whole team is scared of honey badgers," Smith said. "If you don't know why, YouTube it."
<br/><br/>
Walts often joins in on the humor, teasing the team's picky eaters about dinner plans. At one point, he drove around the parking lot of two locations, but wouldn't actually park, to keep the team in frustrated anticipation about the final choice.
<br/><br/>
Smith said friendships also grow with students from other universities through the tournaments.
<br/><br/>
"The debate community is very friendly, very open and accepting," Smith said. "We see each other on a weekly basis. You kind of have to be friendly, or else you are just going to hate every weekend."
<br/><br/>
The art of debate
To the average person, regular debate rounds are 45 minutes of almost inaudible $5 words. Debaters have to train themselves in a number of facets to keep up.
<br/><br/>
The members said the rounds might be difficult to follow for someone without debate experience.
<br/><br/>
"We have a lot of debate jargon, names of types of arguments," Gribbin said. "A lot of it is strategy and technical. They may be able to follow some of the ideas of the arguments, but it might be confusing to someone who doesn't know the lingo."
<br/><br/>
Smith said there are literally hundreds of terms, and part of succeeding is learning what they are and how to use them.
<br/><br/>
"We have link turns, uniquess, nonuniquess, perm, impacts, RBI, plan plan, counter plan, plan plus, plan inclusive, dispostionality, conditionality, unconditionality," Smith said.
<br/><br/>
Walts said debate depends heavily on strategy, not necessarily facts, saying there is no ultimate truth.
<br/><br/>
"Everything can be proven suspect with an argument," Walts said. "There is no truth, I think, is what I wish somebody would have told me very quickly."
<br/><br/>
Warren agreed with Walts and said speed is also a necessary component of debate.
<br/><br/>
"It's not a truth-seeking activity," he said. "I can't say, 'I won because I was on the right side, and it's just a fact.' It's how I apply the facts. It's not a perfect system in that regard. The delivery, the speed issue makes it hard to translate."
<br/><br/>
Warren said they speak about 300 words per minute during each speech, which is five words per second. Warren said, however, the general ideas of debate rounds are reasonable.
<br/><br/>
"I think the broad concepts are relatable, the general topic," he said. "For instance, one of the topics we had this past weekend involved raising the minimum age for Social Security. People have some grasp of the Social Security system."
<br/><br/>
Another thing debaters gain from the activity is confidence. Jones said he gets nervous sometimes; but once he gets into the round, it goes away.
<br/><br/>
"It's just like something hits you, and you're in the middle of a battle," he said. "It's a unique experience."
<br/><br/>
Walts said while participating in debate, members learn the "survival skills of life."
<br/><br/>
"It also teaches them critical thinking skills, the ability to organize their thoughts; so when they get out in the world, they have an ability to out present competitors around them and impress their bosses," he said. "Literally, every tool I think you need to survive in the world, you get taught in debate."
<br/><br/>
Walts said while the team makes sacrifices like forgoing spring break to prepare for the national tournament, the knowledge and skills gained are priceless.
<br/><br/>
"Educationally, they gain a level of knowledge about the world around them and global issues that is unparalleled," he said. "They learn so much about issues in the world that it is the literally the epitome of a liberal arts degree."

						<label for="ac-16">Study finds doodling aids in concentration</label>
						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>Feature<br/>
						October 11, 2010<br/><br/></b>
						 
						Doodling is more than just a classroom distraction.
<br/><br/>
The little boxes and squiggles students doodle while listening to a lecturing professor can actually improve memorization, according to a 2009 study.
<br/><br/>
However, professors reported a recent decrease in doodling and an increase in real distractions like daydreaming and technology.
<br/><br/>
A 2009 study conducted by Dr. Jackie Andrade, postgraduate research coordinator for the School of Psychology at the University of Plymouth, found that doodling could be the most beneficial way to fight boredom.
<br/><br/>
"Doodling helps to stop daydreaming by giving your brain more information to process without interfering with the main task you are doing, which is listening to the phone message or lecture," Andrade said in an e-mail interview.
<br/><br/>
She said once a daydream starts, it takes mental resources away from the task.
<br/><br/>
"In particular, it uses high-level or executive resources that are important for mental control and concentration," Andrade said. "Doodling also takes some mental effort, of course, but it needs mainly visual and spatial processes and few executive resources."
<br/><br/>
In other words, doodling requires cognitive effort, but not so much that it causes a complete distraction as daydreaming often does.
<br/><br/>
"Daydreams also tend to be about things that are important to us, 'Where shall I go tonight? What shall I eat for lunch? Should I smoke another cigarette? Will my friends think I'm stupid?''' Andrade said. "So it can be hard to break out of a daydream and get back to concentrating on the task in hand."
<br/><br/>
Teaching assistant Brandon Nepote has a sketchbook with him every day of his life and has for the past nine years.
<br/><br/>
"I can't say I did it in high school, but in college I doodled every day, every class period, every lecture," Nepote said. "Now I'm about to receive my M.F.A. So, obviously I think it works."
<br/><br/>
Brian Simpson, sophomore speech communication major, said he also doodles every day.
<br/><br/>
"If I doodle, I still pay attention," Simpson said. "The doodling helps me from staring out the window and stuff. I will write down notes and just draw off the notes little stick figures and stuff, short and random."
<br/><br/>
In Andrade's study, 40 participants listened to a two-and-a-half-minute mock phone message and recalled information. The participants also shaded in 10 shapes, aligned in alternating rows of circles and squares.
<br/><br/>
Andrade did not allow participants to doodle naturally to prevent inaccurate results due to self-consciousness.
<br/><br/>
"People will tune their doodling according to the demands of the other task they are doing, but it is hard to test naturalistic doodling in the laboratory," Andrade said. "If I ask you to doodle during an experiment, you might feel quite self-conscious about what a psychologist will think of your doodles. Naturalistic doodling isn't self-conscious like that, and I hoped the shape-shading task would capture the more spontaneous, absent-minded feel of naturalistic doodling."
<br/><br/>
Juan Salinas, psychology lecturer at The University of Texas at Austin, said students usually doodle because they are not engaged enough. He said an "upside-down U" response to being excited or interested is common.
<br/><br/>
"If your emotional state of activity when you're learning is too low, learning won't be enhanced, like you're bored," Salinas said in a phone interview. "And then being too excited or agitated also impairs it. There's a middle ground when you're emotionally engaged when memory is facilitated."
<br/><br/>
Salinas said doodling can make things just exciting or interesting enough to facilitate absorption of information.
<br/><br/>
"We are visual creatures," he said. "Visual stimulation may play a bigger role for a lot of people."
<br/><br/>
He also said students pay attention and focus based on how they like to learn.
<br/><br/>
"No matter how well you write the textbook, some will need pictures," Salinas said. "People may need a little verbal tune or songs to help them remember something. If doodling is what it takes, well, then doodling is what it takes."
<br/><br/>
Salinas said relating the material to the students' lives also helps.
<br/><br/>
"You think of the imagery from your own personal experience," he said. "They start to organize the new information on the basis of something they know already. Sometimes that prior experience and seeing the connection, while it may be indirect, can help."
<br/><br/>
Victor Scherb, University English professor, said he notices doodling occasionally.
<br/><br/>
"I can't say I've particularly noticed any recently," Scherb said. "I only notice it about once a term. That doesn't mean they haven't done it. It just means I don't notice."
<br/><br/>
Dr. David Beams, University electrical engineering associate professor, said he has not noticed doodling recently either, but it is not always easy to spot.
<br/><br/>
"If someone is drawing meaningless pictures on his or her notes, it's difficult to tell that from if they are actually taking notes," Beams said.
<br/><br/>
Another explanation for the lack of doodling is technology. Beams said usually students are distracted by their laptops.
<br/><br/>
"The ones that are blatant are when someone whips open a laptop and starts in on it when there's really no purpose or reason for them to have a laptop open," he said. "If someone is playing with his or her laptop, I have to wonder if they are really paying attention or not."
<br/><br/>
Beams also said he can tell if students are daydreaming by their body language.
<br/><br/>
"They don't seem, by their body language or their eyes, to be paying attention," he said. "Their eyes aren't following you or their body language is detached. They slouch."
<br/><br/>
Beams said he notices a distracted student just about every day.
<br/><br/>
"I daydream everyday," sophomore Daniel Pineda said. "There are just so many other things going on besides class in my life."
<br/><br/>
While doodling could be a preventative measure for daydreaming and the distraction of technology, it also can reveal subconscious thoughts.
<br/><br/>
Although primarily known for analyze handwriting, some graphologists also interpret doodles.
<br/><br/>
Some doodles are more common than others. People doodle boxes more than any other doodle, according to "Handwriting Analysis: Putting it to Work For You" by Andrea McNichol and Jeffrey Nelson.
<br/><br/>
While all boxes indicate a desire to be constructive, three-dimensional ones strongly imply the ability to see all sides of an issue, McNichol and Nelson said.

						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>News<br/>
						October 11, 2010<br/><br/></b>
						 
						Former University President Dr. George F. Hamm, whose tenure oversaw the development of the first campus student housing and performing arts venue, died Sunday after a brief illness. He was 79.
<br/><br/>
Hamm, the second president in University history, served from 1981 to 1998. He succeeded president Dr. James Stewart who served from 1971 to 1981 and preceded current University president Dr. Rodney Mabry.
<br/><br/>
In a prepared statement released late Sunday, Mabry praised Hamm for his accomplishments as president, including his work with state legislatures to pass a bill allowing the University to be four-year instead of an upper-level university.
<br/><br/>
"President Hamm influenced the University and the community in such important ways," Mabry said. "He was a major force in the development of the university, and students, faculty and staff will be forever in his debt."
<br/><br/>
Dr. Pat Gajda, who has worked as a history professor at the University since 1974, recalled Hamm as close friend.
<br/><br/>
"He put the University on the map, literally," Gajda said. "He had signs put up in front of the University and had maps published with the University marked on them. I loved him dearly, I can't believe he's gone."
<br/><br/>
Visitation will be Wednesday from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Stewart Family Funeral Home. The service will be Thursday at 11 a.m. at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Tyler.
<br/><br/>
Hamm was born in Rapid City, South Dakota on June 26, 1931. He earned his bachelors degree from South Dakota State University. He then joined the U.S. Army and spent 16 months leading infantry in Korea.
<br/><br/>
After his time in the military he earned his masters degree in experimental psychology from the University of Wyoming. While in Wyoming he met his wife of 52 years, Janie.
<br/><br/>
Hamm earned his doctoral degree from the University of Wyoming, and then worked as assistant dean there.
<br/><br/>
After spending 20 years as dean of students at Arizona State University, Hamm interviewed for the position of president of UT Tyler. He accepted the position, and began serving his term in August of 1981. By the end of his second semester, student enrollment has grown to 2,344.
<br/><br/>
U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall sponsored a congressional resolution commending Hamm in 1998 for his "unmatched leadership and vision to the University."
<br/><br/>
When Hamm announced his retirement, he described his years at the University as, "the best and happiest years of my professional life."
<br/><br/>
In honor to his contributions to the University, UT System Board of Regents granted him the title of President Emeritus in 2003.
<br/><br/>
There are no immediate plans for University memorial. Funeral arrangements are pending with Stewart Family Funeral Home in Tyler.
<br/><br/>
Hamm is survived by his wife Janie, his children Greg Hamm of Virginia and Jean Marie Glass of Tyler, and six grandchildren.
<br/><br/>
He was preceded in death by two sons, Robert Joseph Hamm and Daniel George.

						A loan gunman fired several shots from an AK-47 at The University of Texas at Austin Tuesday morning before committing suicide on the sixth floor of Perry-Casteneda Library, officials said.
<br/><br/>
Police officials identified the gunman as 19-year-old Colton Tooley, UT Austin sophomore.
<br/><br/>
Law enforcement said several descriptions of the gunman were reported, but dismissed the rumors of another suspect, after conducting a secondary search.
<br/><br/>
Matt loving, UT Austin student, said he took cover in the graduate school dining area because most other places had windows.
<br/><br/>
"It was a weird place to be. We didn't really know what was going on because they cut our cable on campus, but we knew it wasn't good," Loving said. "Some people were terrified, some were annoyed, and some just wanted to get off campus. I've never seen the campus so still."
<br/><br/>
This incident is not the first shooting to take place on the UT Austin campus. In 1966, Charles Whitman, former student and Marine, killed 16 people and wounded 32 others, making it the second deadliest university shooting in U.S. history.
<br/><br/>
The deadliest university shooting was the Virgina Tech massacre in 2007, where Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people.
<br/><br/>
The third deadliest university shooting happened in 1976 at California State University. Edward Charles Allaway killed seven people and wounded two others in the library basement.
<br/><br/>
The fourth deadliest university shooting took place in 2008 at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb Illinois.
<br/><br/>
"You go to college and you're like, OK, that is considered to be a safe zone..." Jordan Hanke, former NIU student, said. "That's a real shock, you know, when something you think is safe is not safe."
<br/><br/>
Six people were killed and 18 were wounded in the NIU shooting.
<br/><br/>
"We sat there, you know, when the Virgina Tech thing happened and thought, 'well, that's never going to happen here,'" he said. "These people were shot, and they're dragging them out... and you see kids with cell phones taking pictures of them. That was probably the saddest thing."
<br/><br/>
Robert Dahlstrom, UT Austin police chief, said at a press conference that they sent out text messages to students, faculty and staff to warn them of the incident.
<br/><br/>
The UT Austin alert system includes the emergency siren, loudspeaker system on campus, emergency text messages and online communication, according to the UT Austin Web site.
<br/><br/>
Alex Hatoum, UT Austin philosophy major, said the emergency alert system notified him of the incident.
<br/><br/>
"The main thing that I remember was the sudden shock and then everyone just contacting each other and making sure everything was OK," Hatoum said. "To be honest, Facebook helped us feel more at ease since we all got on to see if everyone else was on."
<br/><br/>
The University of Texas at Tyler has a similar emergency alert system called PatriotALERT.
<br/><br/>
"This is exactly a situation, had it occurred on our campus, that the emergency alert system (PatriotALERT) would have been activated," Beverley Golden, UT Tyler news and information director, said.
<br/><br/>
According to the UT Tyler Web site, PatriotALERT can send e-mail, voice and text messages to the campus community within minutes.
<br/><br/>
All students have the opportunity to use PatriotALERT by entering contact information, specifically phone numbers, under the "Personal Information" section of myUTTyler. For more information about PatriotALERT, go to http://www.uttyler.edu/emergency/patriotalert/.
<br/><br/>
Once a student has been alerted of an emergency situation, they should follow University security protocol, which can be found at http://www.uttyler.edu/emergency/flipchart0808.pdf.
<br/><br/>
"Also, students, staff, and faculty will be emailed a link to the annual security report on Friday, October 1, 2010 which will contain information concerning emergency evacuation/sheltering and emergency notification," Golden said.

						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>News<br/>
						 September 14, 2010<br/><br/></b>
						 
						For the first time, University students and professors are using the full version of Tegrity, a lecture capture software that allows 24-hour, online access to lectures recorded by professors.
<br/><br/>
President Rodney Mabry said at the Faculty and Staff Convocation on Aug. 23 that Tegrity is an important step in integrating technology in the educational process.
<br/><br/>
Dr. Mabry said students immerse themselves in technology and consequently learn more when using it. Mabry pointed out the Tegrity's accessibility could allow students to study "in their jammies at midnight."
<br/><br/>
A pilot of Tegrity was administered last spring and summer to test the software. The pilot lacked some features, but mainly was intended to allow students and professors the opportunity to experience the basic functions of the software.
<br/><br/>
"With the pilot program, we saw students ... go back and review, not necessarily their own notes, but exactly what the instructor said," Blackboard administrator Scott Dillingham said. "They (students) will be able to go back and see the lecture anytime. UT Tyler wants to integrate technology to help students learn."
<br/><br/>
Tegrity offers features intended to aid in student education. For example, Tegrity recognizes significant screen changes, such as when a professor goes from one slide to another in a PowerPoint presentation. Tegrity then breaks down the lecture into chapters categorized by the screen changes.
<br/><br/>
"It let's you study in a targeted way and not have to go through and watch the whole thing," Dillingham said. "So if a student wants to see just the end of the lecture, they can."
<br/><br/>
Students also can search text in a video, and Tegrity can bring up all the points in which the text is used.
<br/><br/>
Internet connection speed can sometimes be an issue when students view videos on Tegrity. However, Tegrity allows students to download videos on their personal computer, which means students can have access to it anywhere.
<br/><br/>
Professors must request Tegrity to use it. Once they have, a link should appear in Blackboard for student access, Dillingham said.
<br/><br/>
Group training sessions are scheduled throughout the semester for professors who are unfamiliar with the software.
<br/><br/>
"We've done three trainings so far," Cindy Smith, instructional design coordinator, said. "I've had to close every session because they were maxed out. The interest is there."
<br/><br/>
Smith said about 53 professors signed up for the September training sessions.
<br/><br/>
Sessions are scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Wednesday and Nov. 9 in Room 115 of Muntz Library.
<br/><br/>
Smith said professors can contact her for additional information about training and training dates at cindy_smith@uttyler.edu.
<br/><br/>
Some professors are familiar with Tegrity after using the pilot.
<br/><br/>
"For some students, this was very helpful, as they had an opportunity to listen and review at their leisure," assistant professor Kathy Missildine said. "Tegrity is very easy to use, for both the students and the faculty. Some used the recordings, especially during review for exams."
<br/><br/>
Two nursing classes, Medical-Surgical Nursing I and II, are substituting traditional classroom lecture for Tegrity this semester.
<br/><br/>
Missildine said class time is used instead to provide interactive learning experiences, such as clinical simulations, case studies, games and role play to involve students more actively in learning.
<br/><br/>
"This semester in these two classes, at least, our approach is different," Missildine said. "We have taken advantage of the availability of lectures via Tegrity, and can utilize class time more optimally. Students are given clinical credit for the time they spend in these interactive sessions. We will determine the effect this has on student grades in those courses, compared to the usual classroom approach."
<br/><br/>
Kacey Hirsch, junior nursing major, said she is using Tegrity this semester but is hesitant about its effectiveness.
<br/><br/>
"Frankly, if I wanted to take an online course, I would have..." Hirsch said. "I have to constantly start and stop just to write stuff down. I finished one unit last night and a two-and-a-half-hour lecture ended up taking me about four hours to complete because of all the starting and stopping I had to do."
<br/><br/>
Hirsch said in addition to traditional class expectations, she now has to worry about viewing lectures on Tegrity. She also said she is not fond of the idea of e-mailing her questions to professors and would rather have the opportunity to ask questions in class.
<br/><br/>
"All in all, I think Tegrity is a good idea in theory, Hirsch said. "However, I see myself struggling this semester."
<br/><br/>
Senior Chloe Sedley said she is using Tegrity this semester for her History of Psychology class. Sedley said while the concept of Tegrity is nice, she has had a number of problems with the software.
<br/><br/>
"It takes forever to load, and it freezes a lot," Sedley said. "We are supposed to be able to download them, but it never works. It's an online class, but it wasn't when I registered for it. I don't appreciate it, because I pay out-of-state tuition to come here."
<br/><br/>
However, Sedley said she believes the amount of class work is the about the same as a traditional class.
<br/><br/>
Music lecturer Vicki Conway said the nature of her classes doesn't fit well with software like Tegrity and has opted not to use it. Other professors have done the same.
<br/><br/>
"I teach piano and a harmony keyboard class, which is like group piano...," Conway said. "It's not a lecture class, and so it doesn't lend itself to the technology of Tegrity. There are some courses that could lend themselves to it, but the ones I teach are more specifically applied classes in piano."
<br/><br/>
Another concern about Tegrity is how it may affect class attendance.
<br/><br/>
Missildine said Tegrity mainly decreased attendance when used as a backup for in-class lecture.
<br/><br/>
"Absences from class were increased somewhat," she said. "Some students were quite adept at learning the content by just the use of Tegrity and sometimes opted to just go to class via the online recordings."
<br/><br/>
Mabry expects Tegrity to have a positive effect on hybrid courses, which are classes comprised of about two-thirds traditional lecture and one-third online instruction, because of student adaption to technology.
<br/><br/>
"I have found it easy to use, and it is certainly useful. There is no way we could reasonably do an online class without the ability to record lectures, and I think it is probably easier to be able to see the professor as well as hear him and look at the PowerPoints," visiting professor John Gill said.
<br/><br/>
Mabry said the use of online education offers a number of advantages to the University. He said with fewer students on campus, fewer classrooms and facilities should be required. Also, less face-to-face lecture should allow more time for professors to help students individually, answer questions online or for research efforts.
<br/><br/>
The license to use the software costs the University $42,344, Smith said. Users purchase Tegrity licenses by numbers of recorded hours. The University's license covers 1,250 hours.
<br/><br/>
Smith said every faculty member and every classroom has the ability to use the software, and they also have gotten requests from non-faculty, but the cost should only rise if the amount of recorded hours goes above 1,250. She said they don't expect to rise above the allotted amount of hours anytime soon.
<br/><br/>
"It (cost) will go up a little if we exceed that, but it doesn't matter how many people use it," she said. "We can have an unlimited amount of users."
<br/><br/>
Smith said the amount of hours they purchase in the future depends on student and professor feedback.
<br/><br/>
"If students like it, we will continue doing it," she said. "If it's something they don't find beneficial, we will probably back off of it."

						The Campus Activities Board provided students with free food and Inflatable games by Harvey Lake on Wednesday as a part of Patriot Palooza.
<br/><br/>
The weeklong event held to welcome new students to the University began Aug. 23 and is scheduled to continue through Aug. 27.
<br/><br/>
The Campus Activities Board along with other University organizations, coordinate events to introduce freshmen and transfer students to the University and get them involved in campus life.
<br/><br/>
"[Patriot Palooza] does a great job getting everyone together, especially new freshmen," senior Salem Washmon said. "There are several more events this week I've seen on the CAB Facebook page that I want to go to."
<br/><br/>
CAB plans to have information tables by Harvey Lake from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday. The library will provide information tables to give new students general information about the campus including building and class locations.
<br/><br/>
Two recreational sports events will also be held Thursday to inform students about recreational sports on campus.
<br/><br/>
The first is planned from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Patriot Center and a second is planned to be from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. at University Pines.
<br/><br/>
The CAB Water Balloon Twist and Capture the Flag will take place from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday on the intramural field.
<br/><br/>
The last Patriot Palooza event this week will be the Student Government Association Welcome Back Pool Party from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday. It will take place at the pool located outside the Herrington Patriot Center.
<br/><br/>
CAB canceled the Student Organization Leadership Retreat due to budget constraints. Jennifer Skinner, student development specialist, said it may be rescheduled in the spring.
<br/><br/>
"We've had a really good turnout to the events that we've had so far," Skinner said. "We have a great group of really enthusiast students. I think it will be a great year."
<br/><br/>
Patriot Palooza has coordinated a number of events this week including two CAB Movie Nights, CAB Comedy Night, a student organization showcase called Swoopstation, the Back to School BBQ Bash with inflatable games and the Ice Cream-a-Palooza with Greek Life and Career Services.
<br/><br/>
Stanley's Famous Pit Bar-B-Q catered the Back to School BBQ Bash, that fed about 400 students.
<br/><br/>
"We are here at least three times a year," Nic Pencis, Owner of Stanley's Famous Pit Bar-B-Q, said. "I love to be here. It's great to get a feel for what people this age are doing and into."
<br/><br/>
More information and updates on Patriot Palooza will be provided at www.patriottalon.com throughout the week.

						<label for="ac-21">University pursues hiring freezes, budget cuts</label>
						<div class="article ac-extralarge">
						<p><b>News<br/>
						 June 22, 2010<br/><br/></b>
						 
						The University is reorganizing staff, reducing expenditures and freezing most new hires to respond to anticipated reductions in state funding.
<br/><br/>
In addition to a 5 percent cut in the current budget, University officials are gearing up for an additional 10 percent reduction for the current biennium, according to University officials.
<br/><br/>
"I don't want to panic. I want to prepare," Gregg Lassen J.D, Executive Vice President for Business Affairs, said.
<br/><br/>
Two University committees convened to identify and recommend ways to save money.
<br/><br/>
The Cost Containment Committee, headed by Lassen, examined the issue of budget cuts and where to apply them.
<br/><br/>
The Academic Reorganization and Revitalization Task Force, lead by Provost Peter Fos, looked for ways to contain costs and reduce expenditures.
<br/><br/>
About 118 positions will have been eliminated from the UT System as a whole by Sept. 1, according to a message from the Chancellor, but Lassen said that while about half of the University's operating costs are employee salaries, layoffs are a long way off for this campus.
<br/><br/>
"We are working very hard, and we value our employees like family," Lassen said. "We will do everything possible first."
<br/><br/>
The Cost Containment Committee and The Academic Task Force have examined ways to cut costs within the university.
<br/><br/>
Immediate recommended actions include flexible freezes on hiring and purchases, curtailments on travel and reductions in part-time pay. There will be increased efforts to conserve energy. Auxiliary operations will be required to become self-funding.
<br/><br/>
Other cost-cutting options won't be so easy, said President Rodney Mabry in a June 10 memo to University employees.
<br/><br/>
"We have arrived at an important crossroads for the University. Most of the easy cost containment measures have been taken ... We cannot just continue going down this path of taking the easy, short-run measures that hurt everyone somewhat evenly, but do nothing to solve the long-run problem." Mabry said in the memo there will be changes that make the university "a leaner and more effective educational institution."
<br/><br/>
Such measures would include furloughs (a euphemism for across-the-board pay cuts) and reductions in marketing and student services.
<br/><br/>
However, Mabry also said they want to avoid reductions in marketing and student services because of the consequences to enrollment and university growth.
<br/><br/>
Lassen said the reduction in state funding and cap on tuition costs give the university more incentive to grow.
<br/><br/>
"For us to thrive, we need to stop being a well kept secret," Lassen said. "The cost of education hasn't changed. Who pays it has, and we are doing everything we can to keep this from affecting the students."
<br/><br/>
A 10 percent cut in the annual budget would be approximately $5 million.
<br/><br/>
Ten percent "would obviously be a significant reduction in funding from the state, and we must start now if we are to conserve that amount of funding without doing harm to our mission," Lassen said in a June 16 letter to faculty and staff. "To avoid more draconian actions such as large layoffs or furloughs, we must take action immediately on some of the valuable recommendations of our two groups."
<br/><br/>
Some of the changes already taking place include:
Col. Jesse Acosta is taking on new duties and sharing others with Lassen. Acosta's position as chief of staff will be eliminated July 1. Dr. Howard Patterson is taking over the role of athletic director, replacing James Vilade, who left the University this month after accepting a new job in Plano. A full-time and a half-time position were eliminated in Alumni Affairs.
<br/><br/>
University officials also expect to eliminate 80 percent of small classes (classes with less than 20 students), cut adjunct faculty positions and increase the emphasis on on-line education.
<br/><br/>
Efforts are under way to implement ways to increase revenue such as implementing a professional educational program and boosting enrollment. "Our primary mission is to give students an education," Lassen said. "We don't want to hurt that."
